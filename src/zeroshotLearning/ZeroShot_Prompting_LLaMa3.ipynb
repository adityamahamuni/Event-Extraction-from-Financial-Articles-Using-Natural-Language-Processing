Law enforcement agencies around the world have welcomed the report, which is based on 63 field studies, conducted across 50 countries including Russia, Canada, Malaysia, and the Philippines where tobacco smugglers currently have a strong presence. JTI intelligence found that the global public health crisis and financial downturn has created the conditions for a 'perfect storm' where organized criminal groups will further exploit public demand for cheap goods, and capitalize on dwindling buying power in the impending global recession, particularly in countries with high tax regimes. The report has provided JTI with a global picture of four emerging trends, consistent with Euromonitor and Europol intelligence: 1. Evidence shows that criminal groups are biding their time in readiness for an anticipated boom in illegal tobacco sales; 2. After initial disruption to the illegal supply chain in Western European markets, organizedcriminals quickly exploited the inconsistent approach to travel and lockdownrulesand found alternative routes from production to distribution, leading to significant seizures of illegal factories or their components in countries such as the Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland, Belgium, and Spain; 3. Changed law enforcement priorities and border restrictions have been mixed in limiting supply and the availability of illegal tobacco: whilst governments and authorities in Far East Asia were quicker to impose restrictions, those in the West failed to act with such precision; 4. Technology has been increasingly deployed throughout the pandemic to enable sales of illegal tobacco to continue where strict lockdowns were put in place by governments throughout Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific, where WhatsApp and Facebook have provided quick and easy methods of communication between the consumer and criminals. Furthermore, the International Chamber of Commerce predicts that global counterfeit trade will reach $4 trillion by 2022, primarily fueled by e-commerce[1]. According to the World Bank, the global trade in illegal tobacco is already worth an estimated $40-50 billion each year to the criminal groups who produce, manufacture, smuggle, distribute and sell tobacco products on which there is no tax duty paid. The loss of revenue to law-abiding retailers is also significantly felt, as is the impact on consumers who are lured into buying sub-standard products. \"To some consumers illegal tobacco is a victimless crime, which is why we need to inform them not only of the hidden dangers they are consuming, but the wider social consequences of buying from criminal groups\"\n",

      "Sentence: \"TOP Ships Announces Reverse Stock Split ATHENS, Greece, Aug. 07, 2020 ( ) TOP Ships Inc. ( NASDAQ: TOPS ) ( the Company ), announced today that it has determined to effect a 1-for-25 reverse stock split of the Company s issued common shares. The Company s shareholders approved the reverse stock split and granted the Board the authority to determine the exact split ratio and when to proceed with the reverse stock split at the Company s Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 29, 2020. The reverse stock split will take effect, and the Company s common stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on the NASDAQ Capital Market, as of the opening of trading on Monday, August 10, 2020 under the existing ticker symbol TOPS. The new CUSIP number for the Company s common stock will be Y8897Y 180. When the reverse stock split becomes effective, every 25 shares of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock will be automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock without any change in the par value per share or the total number of authorized shares. This will reduce the number of outstanding shares of the Company s common stock from approximately 995.8 million shares to approximately 39.8 million shares. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse split of the issued and outstanding common stock. Shareholders shall be paid cash-in-lieu of a fractional shares that occur as a result of the reverse stock split. Shareholders will receive instructions from the Company s exchange agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as to how to exchange existing share certificates for new certificates representing the post-reverse split shares.

      "Processing sentence: JTI report warns of a 'Gathering Storm' in the black market English English Intelligence shows criminals are ready for post-Covid boom GENEVA , Sept . 11 , 2020 / / JTI ( Japan Tobacco International ) has published a report , independently verified by Intrinsic Insight Ltd. , entitled 'The Gathering Storm' , on how the illegal tobacco trade are operating during the Covid-19 global pandemic and preparing to reap the rewards in the economic aftermath that will follow . Law enforcement agencies around the world have welcomed the report , which is based on 63 field studies , conducted across 50 countries including Russia , Canada , Malaysia , and the Philippines where tobacco smugglers currently have a strong presence . JTI intelligence found that the global public health crisis and financial downturn has created the conditions for a 'perfect storm' where organized criminal groups will further exploit public demand for cheap goods , and capitalize on dwindling buying power in the impending global recession , particularly in countries with high tax regimes . The report has provided JTI with a global picture of four emerging trends , consistent with Euromonitor and Europol intelligence: 1 . Evidence shows that criminal groups are biding their time in readiness for an anticipated boom in illegal tobacco sales; 2 . After initial disruption to the illegal supply chain in Western European markets , organizedcriminals quickly exploited the inconsistent approach to travel and lockdownrulesand found alternative routes from production to distribution , leading to significant seizures of illegal factories or their components in countries such as the Czech Republic , Greece , Ireland , Belgium , and Spain; 3 . Changed law enforcement priorities and border restrictions have been mixed in limiting supply and the availability of illegal tobacco: whilst governments and authorities in Far East Asia were quicker to impose restrictions , those in the West failed to act with such precision; 4 . Technology has been increasingly deployed throughout the pandemic to enable sales of illegal tobacco to continue where strict lockdowns were put in place by governments throughout Eastern Europe , the Middle East , Africa and Asia Pacific , where WhatsApp and Facebook have provided quick and easy methods of communication between the consumer and criminals . Furthermore , the International Chamber of Commerce predicts that global counterfeit trade will reach $4 trillion by 2022 , primarily fueled by e-commerce[1] . According to the World Bank , the global trade in illegal tobacco is already worth an estimated $40-50 billion each year to the criminal groups who produce , manufacture , smuggle , distribute and sell tobacco products on which there is no tax duty paid . The loss of revenue to law-abiding retailers is also significantly felt , as is the impact on consumers who are lured into buying sub-standard products . \"To some consumers illegal tobacco is a victimless crime , which is why we need to inform them not only of the hidden dangers they are consuming , but the wider social consequences of buying from criminal groups\n",

      "Processing sentence: Diagnostic Testing Capabilities Improve in the Face of Global Turmoil FinancialBuzz.com News Commentary NEW YORK , Oct . 23 , 2020 / / While biotech companies work on vaccines and possible treatments and medical device companies focus on patient monitoring solutions , many others have been working on improving testing options . For example , numerous companies are now racing to develop antibody tests , also called serological tests , that can confirm whether someone was infected even after their immune system has cleared the virus . However , home tests are still not authorized in the U.S . The rapid at-home coronavirus tests could help bring the U.S.' surging outbreak under control , but the innovative medical firms are yet to develop tests that will convince regulators that the public can be trusted to use them correctly . \"If this was a disease that only impacted the individual , then it wouldn't be such a problem,\" said Georges Benjamin , Executive Director of the American Public Health Association , according to a report by Politico . \"The problem is that there will be a cohort of people who will take the test , find out that they are presumably negative , but they really weren't , and go out and infect other people.\" Todos Medical Ltd .

More than 733,000 of those cases have been confirmed in the last two weeks . The country still falls behind many others on widescale testing , and experts claim that the lack of aggressive and consistent testing has contributed to the virus's spread . \"If we really wanted to get things under control , frequent testing of almost everybody would be one way to do it and we're , of course , nowhere near that,\" Marc Lipsitch , a Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H . Chan School of Public Health , said . \"We're doing infrequent testing of almost no one.\" Todos Medical Ltd.

In addition to this investment , ECPA also plans to ramp up waste collection and increase the levels of training among farmers in Europe as part of its response to the EU's Farm to Fork and Biodiversity strategies . G raldine Kutas , European Crop Protection Association Director General , said: \"With its ambitious European Green Deal , the European Commission has fired the starting gun for the EU's run towards a more sustainable , climate-neutral future.\" \"We are serious about contributing and aligning with the Green Deal policy initiatives which is why our companies have joined together to set our own voluntary , sector-specific , measurable goals in their support.\" The six commitments adopted by ECPA will guide the sector for the next decade in key areas of agricultural innovative technologies , the circular economy and better protection of people and the environment: Innovation & Investment: By supporting innovation and the deployment of digital and precision tools as well as biopesticides , we further the European Commission's ambition of a digital and green recovery . By 2030 we will be investing 10 billion euros into innovation in precision and digital technologies and 4 billion euros into innovation in biopesticides . All the investment the industry is committing to is only useful if there is the appropriate regulatory framework allowing the innovation to reach the European farmers . Circular Economy: By increasing the collection rate of the empty pesticides plastic containers to 75% and establishing a collection scheme in the EU Member States that currently have none by 2025 , we will contribute to the EU's goal of a circular economy that aims at minimising waste and resources used , lessening the environmental impact of plastic packaging . Protecting People & Environment: By training farmers on the implementation of Integrated Pest Management , water protection and the importance of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) , our industry desires to further minimise exposure and reduce the risks of pesticide use , all while contributing to the overall goals of the Sustainable Use Directive and EU Farm to Fork strategies aiming at producing enough food sustainably . G raldine Kutas added: \"We all agree on the direction of travel , what's important now is making those deliberate steps to reach the end goal . \"These commitments will be challenging for our companies to deliver on . However , we are committed to deliver on what we have set out for and call on the European Commission to support sustainable agriculture with appropriate regulatory framework allowing the innovation to reach the farmers . \"This is just the beginning ,\n"

The University of Illinois plans to demonstrate a single MMR operated as a Training , Research and Test Reactor , and to partially re-power the coal-fired Abbott power station by providing carbon-free district heating and power to the UIUC campus . The University plans to develop the first generation of commercial micro-reactor operators and will be directly involved in MMR design and integration . Ultra Safe Nuclear also proposes placing a micro-reactor power plant ( MMR Energy System ) at the Idaho National Laboratory to support the demonstration of INL's Integrated Energy Systems ( IES ) , including the optimized carbon-free production of hydrogen by thermo-chemical processes and other zero-carbon energy applications well suited to the high temperature output of the MMR . The deployment of the MMR in the United States will be supported by a first-generation USNC MMR demonstration at the Canadian Nuclear Laboratories at Chalk River , that will be the first micro reactor to be licensed in Canada . The regulatory review of USNC's next-generation ARDP proposed project will benefit from the Canadian project , as design verification and licensing work with the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission ( CNSC ) will be shared with the U.S . Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) , as facilitated through a Memorandum of Cooperation signed between the chairs of the NRC and CNSC in 2019 . Demonstration of USNC's MMR technology in the United States will bring a new level of affordability and reliability to clean power generation , where smaller nuclear plants can be deployed for tens of millions , not billions of dollars . Costs of micro nuclear technology , like renewable energy , are expected to drop rapidly as manufacturing techniques advance and smaller and safer nuclear reactors gain wider acceptance.USNC has launched this initiative fully with private investment which recognizes: 1 ) Improvements in the fuel design and efficiencies of the MMR\n",

The vast majority of Independence Day celebrations were cancelled along with all sporting events , festivals , fairs , and concerts , resulting in little to no income for these family businesses . Now over 95% of all Labor Day events , college and high school football and homecoming events have been cancelled eliminating the false glimmer of hope that the industry held post-Fourth of July to generate some revenue in the Fall to make up for the devastating loss of income in 2020 . \"Because our industry requires large public gatherings , we will be one of the very last industries to fully reopen , sometime in mid-2021 . This has resulted in tremendous financial hardship to professional display fireworks entertainment companies,\" said APA Executive Director , Julie L . Heckman . The American Pyrotechnics Association ( APA ) is urging Congress to enact the Reviving the Economy Sustainability Towards a Recovery in Twenty-twenty ( RESTART ) Act . The APA endorsed the RESTART Act on July 15 , 2020 , in both the Senate and the House . There has been widespread support from 40 trade organizations across the country that the bipartisan RESTART Act can help small businesses and restart the economy . \"The fireworks entertainment industry needs this relief immediately or many display fireworks companies may not be able to survive,\" added Heckman . The primary Senate co-sponsor , Sen . Todd Young of Indiana , held a press conference call on July 2 , 2020 , with Mike Cartolano , President of Indiana-based fireworks events company Melrose Pyrotechnics . \"The fireworks display industry has experienced particular hardship during the coronavirus pandemic . The industry's sales and revenue are centered around events on July 4 , and businesses are struggling to find a way to survive until next year . A loan program created by the RESTART Act would help provide a lifeline to the hardest-hit industries , including the fireworks entertainment industry , for the remainder of 2020,\" said Cartolano . Congressman Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania and Congressman Jared Golden of Maine introduced the RESTART Act in the House . On August 13 , 2020 , Rep .

( Credit: UIC/UI Health ) This new 200,000 square-foot clinical building , located across from the University of Illinois Chicago Hospital , is expected to be completed by Fall 2022 . This unique ownership and transaction structure allowed the Board of Trustees to exercise control over several aspects of the operation , without bearing the burdens typically associated with the ownership and financing of such a project . By incorporating a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) ownership structure , the bonds were able to be secured on a tax exempt basis at very competitive borrowing levels . Such P3 financings can often allow issuers to expedite the delivery of essential assets in a more timely and efficient manner while mitigating certain risks that are typically borne in a traditional public finance offering . \"This is a terrific transaction for the University of Illinois , as well as for the State of Illinois because of its public-private partnership model,\" said Dominick Mondi , Mesirow Financial President & CEO . \"This new outpatient healthcare facility brings substantial benefits to the local regionit will create many well-paying jobs , improve overall patient experience , and provide those requiring outpatient surgery with a state-of-the-art facility .

      "Processing sentence: New Brief: Mandating that Drug Rebates Benefit Consumers will Help Patients with High Out-of-Pocket Drug Costs SAN FRANCISCO , Sept . 30 , 2020 / / A new briefreleased today by the Center for Medical Economics and Innovation at the Pacific Research Institute found that reforms mandating drug rebates benefit patients rather than payers would lower overall health care costs and help patients with expensive out-of-pocket drug costs . Click here to download the brief Continue Reading Pacific Research Institute \"Ironically , the current drug concession system is raising patient costs,\" write the briefs authors , Wayne Winegarden and Robert Popovian . \"Mandating that all drug concessions must benefit the patients purchasing the medicines is a positive reform that meaningfully addresses this problem.\" In \"Reforming Rebates Will Improve Drug Affordability,\" Winegarden and Popovian cite statistics showing that medical care inflation increased 14.5 percent between 2014 and 2019 , yet the net ( or market ) prices of drugs grew just 8.9 percent over the same period . The growth in the market prices of drugs was less than overall medical care inflation.The incentives driving the current drug pricing system promote higher out-of-pocket patient drug costs . Pharmacy benefit managers ( PBMs ) , who manage prescription drug benefits on behalf of third party payers , retain a percentage of drug price concessions . PBMs encourage fast growing list prices offset by fast growing concessions , as they generate more revenue this way . Plan sponsors also benefit because they use a large share of these revenues to offset premiums for all policyholders . Drug company revenues depend on lower net prices , but they compete based on concession sizes . Altogether , the broken system promotes fast growing list prices and concessions , but slow growing net prices.Unfortunately , this complicated pricing structure is harming patients . Insurance drug benefits typically base patient out-of-pocket costs ( i.e . co-insurance and co-payments ) on the inflated list prices not the slower-growing net prices . This is why patient costs are increasing , especially for those who take expensive medications . Among their recommended policy reforms , Winegarden and Popovian recommend changing the manner that rebates are paid so patient costs are tied to net prices , not list prices . Reform would save the overall health care system as more patients would adhere to prescribed prescription drug regimens , leading to fewer emergency room visits and long-term care costs . While Medicare Part D patients may experience small premium increases ( $41 per year ) under this reform , patients with high out-of-pocket costs would save up to $1,763 annually on average . \"Addressing the drug affordability problem requires targeted reforms that identify which patients are bearing the high costs , and the policy inefficiencies that are driving these unwanted outcomes,\" Winegarden and Popovian conclude . The Center for Medical Economics and Innovation at the Pacific Research Institute ( www.medecon.org ) aims to educate policymakers , regulators , health care professionals , the media , and the public on the critical role that\n",

Reversing a stretch of several down months , technology companies returned to hiring by adding an estimated 9,200 net new workers , according to the latest data from the U.S . Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) Employment Situation report . ( #JobsReport ) Conversely , after a strong start to the year , information technology ( IT ) occupations with employers across all sectors of the economy experienced a second consecutive month of losses with a net decline of 323,000 positions . On the year , IT occupations had positive gains in five months , offset by losses in three months , resulting in a net positive of 271,000 new jobs through August . \"On the tech industry employment side , it's encouraging to see the pick-up in hiring among IT services and software firms , especially given the large number of small and medium-size businesses in that sector,\" said Tim Herbert , executive vice president for research and market intelligence at CompTIA . \"On the tech occupation employment side , the data does run counter to expectations , so we have to be careful not to read too much into any single month,\" Herbert continued . \"The macro trend , however , remains unchanged with a continuation of the positive tech employment trajectory.\" Within the technology sector in August two employment categories added jobs , recorded job gains , two experienced losses and a fifth was unchanged . The employment totals reflect a combination of both technical and non-technical positions in technology businesses . The categories of IT services and custom software development ( +12,800 ) and computer and electronic products manufacturing ( +2,300 ) saw employment growth . Those numbers were offset somewhat by job reductions in data processing hosting and related services ( -3,200 ) and telecommunications ( -2,700 ) . Employment in other information services , including search engines and portals was unchanged . The unemployment rate for IT occupations inched up in August to 4.6% . By historic comparison , IT occupation unemployment peaked at about 6.5% during the Great Recession ( 2007-2009 ) and the dotcom bust ( 2000-2002 ) . U.S . employer job postings for IT occupations totaled nearly 228,000 in August , a slight decline from July .

      "Processing sentence: Insider Buying Signals Gold Industry Momentum FN Media Group Presents Microsmallcap.com Market Commentary NEW YORK , Oct . 19 , 2020 / / As the general economy tanks and precious metal values soar , the mining industry is booming . No one knows this better than the people in charge of mining companies . Over the past few months , plenty of examples have popped up of junior mining company executives buying up stock in their own companies , or institutional investors buying shares under direct influence from the company's own management . When this happens , it can be taken as an indicator that the people who know the company in question best are highly confident in its future . We have seen a surge of insider buying lately , with activity from companies like Graycliff Exploration Ltd . ( CSE: GRAY ) ( FSE: GE0 ) , Yamana Gold ( NYSE: AUY ) ( TSX: YRI ) , Capstone Mining Corp . ( TSX: CS ) ( OTCPK: CSFFF ) , Ivanhoe Mines Ltd ( TSX: IVN ) ( OTCQX: IVPAF ) , and Roxgold ( TSX: ROXG ) ( OTCQX: ROGFF ) . Graycliff Exploration Has Some of the Highest Insider Ownership in the Business Graycliff Exploration Ltd . ( CSE:GRAY ) ( FSE:GE0 ) has a share structure that is about as tight as a mining company can be . More than 60 percent of the Company's shares are owned by management and strategic investors , and the Company has approximately just 15M shares outstanding . This is nearly unheard of in the junior mining industry , where 10 percent insider ownership is typically considered a tight share structure . Graycliff ownership has more skin in the game than nearly any other junior mining company , a clear indication that the group behind this Company believes strongly in the potential of their assets and projects . It's also proof that the Graycliff management legitimately believes their stock is currently undervalued . Graycliff Exploration's Shakespeare Project is what has the Company's management so confident in its future . Located about 80 kilometers west of Sudbury , Ontario , within the prolific Canadian Shield geological region , the site of the Shakespeare Project has been well-known for its mineral potential for over a century , but economic factors have kept Shakespeare closed since 1907 . The mine produced 2,959 oz of gold between 1903 and 1907 . Graycliff is conducting exploration on the property under some of the best gold market conditions in years . The Company commenced its exploration program on September 28 with a program that will include 2,000 meters of drilling . On September 25 , Graycliff Exploration announced that the Company had completed a non-brokered private placement for gross proceeds of $530,000 . The investment comes primarily from one strategic investor . Graycliff intends to use the financing primarily for exploration at the Shakespeare Project .

The ADJUSTABLE TIRE AIR CHUCK is easy to use , safe and convenient . It eliminates the need to check tire pressure with a handheld gauge . It saves time and effort by facilitating accurate tire filling . It also reduces the risk of a sudden blowout . Additionally , it may help prolong tire life by allowing treads to wear evenly at the factory recommended pressure level . A patent application is in process . \"I came up with this idea because it is frustrating putting air in tires and getting all four tires on a vehicle at the same pressure,\" said the inventor . The original design was submitted to the National Sales office of InventHelp . It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers .

      "Processing sentence: Red Cross blood donation testing for COVID-19 antibodies provides new opportunity to help patients battling coronavirus Donors are needed this fall to maintain the blood supply to support the needs of all patients WASHINGTON , Sept . 23 , 2020 / / Beginning this week , plasma from whole blood and platelet donations made through the American Red Cross that test positive for COVID-19 antibodies may now help coronavirus patients in need of convalescent plasma transfusions . This new opportunity to help meet the needs of COVID-19 patients is especially critical as infectious disease experts express concern about a potential second wave of cases in the fall . In April , the Red Cross began collecting COVID-19 convalescent plasma from previously diagnosed individuals , which could only give at one of approximately 170 Red Cross blood donation centers across the country . Convalescent plasma contains COVID-19 antibodies that may help the most critical patients actively fighting this virus . Now , whole blood and platelet donations made at any Red Cross blood drive or blood donation center may be helpful in this effort . The Red Cross encourages eligible individuals to give blood as we come together to help patients in need . To schedule an appointment to donate , individuals may use the Red Cross Blood Donor App , visit RedCrossBlood.org or call 1-800-RED CROSS . \"With only 2% of the U.S . population testing positive for COVID-19 , finding eligible convalescent plasma donors to help patients is a little like finding a needle in a haystack,\" says Dr . Pampee Young , chief medical officer , American Red Cross . \"Being able to use the plasma from all blood donations that test positive for COVID-19 antibodies is a game changer in helping to build a readily available supply of convalescent plasma to ensure patients have access to all treatment options available to help them recover from this terrible virus.\" On Sept . 21 , the Red Cross began secondary testing of donations that come back positive to confirm COVID-19 antibody test results . This enables the Red Cross to then potentially use the plasma from those donations to aid coronavirus patients . These tests are also critical in helping to identify individuals who have COVID-19 antibodies and may qualify as convalescent plasma donors for future donation . RED CROSS ANTIBODY TESTING COVID-19 antibody test results will be available to donors within one to two weeks in the Red Cross Blood Donor App or donor portal at RedCrossBlood.org . Antibody testing may indicate if the donor's immune system has produced antibodies to this coronavirus , regardless of whether an individual experienced COVID-19 symptoms . A positive antibody test result does not confirm infection or immunity . The Red Cross is not testing donors to diagnose illness , referred to as a diagnostic test . The Red Cross hopes that COVID-19 antibody testing will helpprovide our valued donors insight into whether they may have been exposed to this coronavirus.Between June 15 and September 12 , the Red Cross tested more than 1.2\n",

The study , led by researchers at AIVITA Biomedical and the Sue & Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center of the University of California , Irvine , used 3D-retina organoids generated from human stem cells developed by AIVITA to provide insight into the potential use of transplanted retina organoids as a therapeutic option for blinding diseases . In the study , transplanted retina organoid sheets were examined to determine if human stem cell-derived photoreceptors coulddevelop , survive and function in vivo without the support of healthy retina pigment epithelium ( RPE ) . Visual function was examined through a variety of tests , including optokinetic testing ( OKT ) , electroretinogram ( ERG ) , and superior colliculus ( SC ) brain recording . These tests concluded that retina organoid transplantations demonstrated significant improvement in visual function compared to non-surgery and sham surgery controls , supporting the application of AIVITA's stem cell technologies in visual disease therapeutics . \"Leveraging our expertise in stem cell growth and differentiation , I'm excited to see the promise of our technology platform in potential therapeutics for vision loss,\" said Hans Keirstead , Ph.D. , chief executive officer of AIVITA and a contributing author to the paper . \"To our knowledge , this study is the first to show that it's possible for photoreceptors derived from stem cells to survive and function after transplantation when a host has a dysfunctional RPE.\" This work is supported by funding from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine ( CIRM ) and National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) . About AIVITA Biomedical AIVITA Biomedical is a privately held company engaged in the advancement of commercial and clinical-stage programs utilizing curative and regenerative medicines .

Efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 rely in part on serological tests to identify the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in people who have had the illness . Until now , however , many of these tests have been developed rapidly and without the independent data to help assess their analytical performance and enable comparisons between different testing methods . With Access Biologicals' seroconversion panel , diagnostic manufacturers , clinical laboratories and researchers will have a reliable benchmark against which they can develop , validate and troubleshoot other COVID-19 serological assays and testing . \"An effective , sensitive and specific way to identify and confirm the SARS-CoV-2 infection is urgently needed,\" said Mike Crowley , Managing Director Access Biologicals . \"Our COVID-19 seroconversion panel will help serological assays bridge the gap through precise validation , establishing sensitivity and helping determine the pre-seroconversion window period , which is the time after infection and before seroconversion , when antibodies appear.\" Collected in a longitudinal series , the Access Biologicals COVID-19 seroconversion panel consists of 14 members ( units ) of a unique human plasma sample drawn from a single donor during a developing SARS-CoV-2 infection . The panel illustrates the onset and decline of IgM , IgG and Ig total SARS-CoV-2 virus antibody titers over a period of 87 days . The COVID-19 seroconversion panel was tested against enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISA ) and chemiluminescent assays ( CLIA ) to track anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody generation over time . Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection is a valuable tool for identifying COVID-19 immune responses , particularly in asymptomatic and convalescent patients . The COVID-19 seroconversion panel has already been included as an assessment tool for commercial COVID-19 serological diagnostic kits in a U.S . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) project . Access Biologicals will have further discussions with the CDC to find ways to use it in the convalescent-plasma development research field .

One presentation will focus on how certified diabetes educators ( CDE ) impact patients' involvement in their type 2 diabetes management , while the other examines palliative care discussions between people with lung cancer and their healthcare professionals . Both presentations spotlight Health Union's ability to uncover findings that can lead to a better understanding of the patient journey with specific conditions . Certified Diabetes Educators and Type 2 Diabetes Management Health Union's first poster session of APHA 2020 , \"Impact of Certified Diabetes Educators on patient activation in type 2 diabetes management,\" will be presented during the \"What Matters and What Works? Insights and Strategies for Improving Public Health Prevention Efforts and Community Outreach\" session between 5:30 and 6:30 p.m . on Oct . 25 . Leveraging the findings from Health Union's Type 2 Diabetes In America 2019 survey of 2,142 people living with the condition , the research aimed to explore differences in diabetes management between respondents who do and those who don't utilize a CDE in their care . Analysis showed that respondents who use a CDE in their care are more likely to be actively involved in managing their diabetes and employing lifestyle changes to help them do so . The authors for this research are Health Union's Margot Tishberg , associate director of community development; Amna Rizvi , MPH , senior director of community development; Kelsey Midgett , director of community development; Timothy Chhorm , insights operations analyst; and Kaitlyn McNamara , associate director of insights operations .

The research sought to assess if palliative care is being used by people living with lung cancer , whether palliative care discussions are happening between patients and their HCPs and whether lung cancer stage influences discussions . Using findings from Health Union's Lung Cancer In America 2019 survey , the research found that only 18% of patients have discussed palliative care with their HCP and 14% have used palliative care; these rates were even lower among early stage patients .

The Company expects its total net revenue for the third quarter of 2020 to be in the range of RMB2,520 million to RMB2,550 million , representing a year-over-year growth between 35.6% and 37.2% , as compared to its previous guidance in the range of RMB2,640 million to RMB2,680 million .

Although maintaining a year-over-year growth as compared to the third quarter of 2019 , the Company expects its net income in the third quarter of 2020 to decrease significantly from the second quarter of 2020 due to increased revenue sharing fees and content cost .

      "Processing sentence: Holocaust Survivor Leaders Statement On Passing Of Congressman John Lewis MIAMI , July 20 , 2020 / / As leaders of the Holocaust Survivors Foundation USA , we extend our condolences to the family of Congressman John Lewis , and to the American family , on the passing of this American hero . Congressman Lewis helped pave the way for everyone who cared about justice and the fight for equality . He was the most respected member of the United States Congress for a reason: because of his courage , his honesty , and his integrity . May his example inspire all of our citizens to strive for justice and equality , and to do so with urgency . We embrace Congressman Lewis's recent statement in the House of Representatives: \"When you see something that is not right , not just , not fair , you have a moral obligation to say something , to do something . Our children and their children will ask us 'what did you do? what did you say?' We have a mission and a mandate to be on the right side of history.\" We are awed by Congressman Lewis's lifetime of courage in opposing racism and demanding equal rights for African Americans . His commitment to fairness and truth was universal . We are particularly grateful for his stand refusing to attend the \"Million Man March\" in Washington in 1995 , writing: \"I cannot overlook past statements by Louis Farrakhan and others associated with the Nation of Islam which are divisive and bigoted.\" We , who experienced the most extreme hate and bigotry in history , are dwindling in numbers . Still , for the remnants of the surviving generation and our families , there are issues of justice and dignity that remain unresolved . We are compelled to speak out about the need to cooperate in this world . We're all in this together , and need to take care of each other . We share the sense of urgency that Congressman Lewis , as one of the last living participants in the major events of the Civil Rights Movement , expressed in his words and deeds about the need for us all to work together for the freedom , equality , dignity , and rights of all people .

      "Processing sentence: Actinium Pharmaceuticals Successfully Completes First Dosing Cohort in the Phase 1 Study of Actimab-A and Venetoclax Combination Therapy in Relapsed/Refractory AML Patients Combination trial , led by UCLA Medical Center and Principal Investigator Gary Shiller , MD , supported by mechanistic rationale and demonstrated synergy of combining venetoclax with targeted radiation from Actimab-A in preclinical studies NEW YORK , Sept . 23 , 2020 / / Actinium Pharmaceuticals , Inc . ( NYSE AMERICAN: ATNM ) ( the \"Company\" or \"Actinium\" ) today announced that it has successfully completed the first dosing cohort in the Actimab-A and venetoclax combination , multi-center Phase 1 trial for patients with Relapsed or Refractory ( \"R/R\" ) Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) age 18 and above . All patients from the first dosing cohort ( 0.50 uCi/kg of Actimab-A ) completed treatment and cleared their initial safety evaluation , thus allowing the study to proceed to the second dose cohort of 1.0 uCi/kg Actimab-A added to venetoclax . In a poster presentation at the American Association of Cancer Research ( AACR ) Annual Meeting 2019 , Actimab-A was shown to be synergistic with venetoclax in venetoclax resistant cell lines , by depleting MCL-1 , a protein shown to mediate resistance to venetoclax . The ongoing Phase 1 study was planned to replicate this synergy in a clinical setting . Actinium plans to report study proof of concept results in 2021 . Venetoclax is a B-Cell Lymphoma 2 ( BCL-2 ) inhibitor jointly developed and marketed by AbbVie and Genentech that is approved in combination with hypomethylating agents ( \"HMAs\" ) for patients with AML . The use of venetoclax has become widespread in the treatment of fit and unfit patients with R/R AML following its inclusion in the recently expanded National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( \"NCCN\" ) guidelines . Actinium's preclinical research has demonstrated that by adding Actimab-A to venetoclax , the targeted internalized radiation from Actimab-A can deliver potent AML cell killing , as well as effectively deplete MCL-1 levels . The overexpression of MCL-1 , a member of the BCL-2 family which venetoclax does not inhibit , promotes resistance to venetoclax . Thus , Actimab-A reverses resistance to venetoclax and has independent anti-leukemic activity mediated by CD33 as well . \"We are pleased to confirm that the second combination trial in our CD33 program is advancing through the dose escalation study as planned . Despite approval in multiple blood cancers , including AML , most AML patients are not cured with venetoclax regimens and eventually relapse . Based on the preclinical data , synergy with venetoclax and Actimab-A should lead to higher remission rates in R/R AML,\" said Dr . Mark Berger , Actinium's Chief Medical Officer . \"We continue to generate promising data from our broader combination program . For example , the Actimab-A combination trial with chemotherapy agent CLAG-M increased the complete response rate compared to CLAG-M alone in R/R AML patients by 60% . We expect to complete the proof of concept Actimab-A venetoclax combination trial in 2021.\" This Phase\n",

      "Processing sentence: California School Nutrition Association Joins With Representative Susan Davis Asking USDA for School Meal Relief BURBANK , Calif. , Aug . 21 , 2020 / / The California School Nutrition Association ( CSNA ) reached out to Rep . Susan Davis , Congresswoman from San Diego , to draft a letter to USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue , to use his existing authority to extend waivers allowing schools to provide meals to students during the pandemic . The letter , sent to Secretary Perdue on August 7 , was circulated by Rep . Davis among the California Congressional delegation , and was signed by a bipartisan group of twenty-five Members . USDA has issued a number of waivers that allow schools to provide meals using a range of service models so that school children , many of whom rely on school meals as their primary source of nutrition , can have access regardless of how schools provide classes . The most effective waivers are set to expire when schools reopen or August 31 , whichever comes first . With schools reopening , many children are losing access to school meals . \"We are very concerned about how we can serve the children effectively when we don't know where they will be on any given day,\" said Johnna Jenkins , President of the California School Nutrition Association . \"Some of our schools will have children present some days and not others . Some schools will be only distance learning . The counting and claiming requirements for school meals cannot support all of the different ways we need to deliver meals to hungry children . We need USDA to extend the waivers that give us the flexibility needed to feed kids for the whole school year so we can plan , as best we can , and do what we do best.\" The effort by CSNA has the active support of a broad alliance of education groups and county and city departments of education . Several bills to extend the USDA waivers have been introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate , but the legislative process is slow and cumbersome , and the need for relief is immediate . To that end , CSNA worked with Rep . Davis who sits on the Committee on Education and Labor that has jurisdiction over school meals to address the issue directly with the Secretary whose exiting authority during this national emergency can be used to issue the waivers effective immediately .

This decision is based on recent results from pre-planned interim analyses of the pimodivir Phase 3 trial in hospitalized patients with influenza A , that found pimodivir in combination with the standard of care ( SOC ) was very unlikely to demonstrate added benefit in hospitalized patients with influenza A compared to SOC treatment alone . The study in hospitalized patients with influenza A and the parallel Phase 3 study of pimodivir in outpatients with influenza A will be halted . \"While our goal was to develop an innovative new treatment option for patients at risk of respiratory infections , unfortunately these data show that pimodivir does not offer a benefit above the existing standard of care,\" said James Merson , Ph.D. , Global Therapeutic Area Head for Infectious Diseases at Janssen Research & Development . \"At Janssen , we have a deep heritage of caring for those affected by respiratory infectious diseases and will continue to do so , focusing on clinical development programs that we believe will offer transformational medical innovation to patients.\" Pimodivir Phase 3 study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pimodivir in two Phase 3 trials in combination with standard of care ( SOC ) treatment in hospitalized adolescent , adult and elderly participants with influenza A infection ( NCT03376321 , known as 3001 ) , and in non-hospitalized adolescent , adult , and elderly participants with influenza A infection who are at risk of developing complications ( NCT03381196 , known as 3002 ) .

As part of the collaboration , Legion of Bloom will add the solo*CODE authentication tag to its vaporizer products . The codes are already appearing on dispensary store shelves throughout California . California's estimated $3.1 billion legal cannabis market is the largest in the world . As the first state to legalize medicinal cannabis in 1996 , California has long been the vanguard of evolving cannabis regulations . As one of the state's leading fully-licensed eco-conscious cannabis flower and vaporizer producers , Legion of Bloom's collaboration with solo sciences both drives standards in consumer safety while also inspiring legal cannabis companies worldwide to do the same . The continued growth of the legal cannabis industry has made it easier for consumers to discover a range of products with diverse medicinal and recreational effects . However , as the legal market has grown across numerous states , federal regulatory oversight is not in place . Therefore , counterfeit products remain , threatening the safety of all users . In February 2020 , the CDC reported 2,807 vaping-related deaths had occurred since January 1 , 2019 , with an average of 76.9% of those being linked to counterfeit THC vape products , with no centralized production or distribution standards . Thanks to its collaboration with Legion of Bloom , solo sciences has responded by working more broadly to promote public health and safety through the Legal Cannabis for Consumer Safety ( LCCS ) , a coalition of 86 California cannabis industry leaders . LCCS looks to tackle counterfeit products and misinformation through direct action to close 3000+ illicit retailers , strengthen product manufacturing and labeling , and improve testing processes . \"As part of our pledge to the LCCS , we are excited to join forces with solo sciences to give our customers unprecedented assurance that our products are genuine and of the utmost quality,\" said Legion of Bloom CEO , Russell Weisman . \"Thanks to this collaboration , Legion of Bloom's community can rest assured that all of our products are crafted responsibly and with care.\" solo sciences' technology is designed to detect counterfeit products through interactive packaging . Unlike other authentication methods such as QR codes and holograms , which are easily faked and hacked , the solo*CODE a unique identifying mark for every item is secured through four unique inputs and can be integrated into or applied to a pre-existing product or its packaging . The solo*CODE is scanned by consumers using the free solo* mobile app , which decrypts it and verifies product authenticity while also providing consumers with detailed product information . The app also provides a new way for product\n"

The two fans on the flanks feature 11 blades and half-height barrier rings to allow for more lateral dispersion and to provide better airflow through the cooling array . Turbulence between fans is reduced thanks to a reversal of the center fan's rotational direction . A larger heatsink that fills most of the card's 2.9-slot footprint was designed to leverage the increased airflow . To get heat up off the die and into the heatsink array , the surface of the heat spreader is polished with MaxContact technology , which improves smoothness at the microscopic level . The extra flatness allows for better contact with the die for enhanced thermal transfer . Improvements are not limited to the cooling array top-shelf capacitors , chokes and power stages effortlessly deliver hundreds of watts at a millisecond's notice .

This initial offering includes Environmental and Social ( ES ) scores for 252 companies in the Oil & Gas sector , and Board Composition scores for more than 4,300 companies across multiple industries . \"ESG data is critical to the investment process . We see an opportunity to provide transparent and complete scoring methodologies along with the underlying data in order to support investment and finance professionals make informed decisions,\" said Patricia Torres , Global Head of Bloomberg Sustainable Finance Solutions . \"By providing transparent ESG data and scores , we are helping investors decode raw data that is otherwise hard to compare across companies . For corporates , these scores offer a valuable , quantitative and normalized benchmark that will easily highlight their ESG performance.\" The ES scores will begin with the Oil & Gas sector as there is typically stronger disclosure data from these companies , which account for more than half of carbon dioxide emissions related to fuel combustion and generate 15% of global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions , according to the IEA . The governance scores will start with Board Composition as there has been increased scrutiny on the role of corporate boards in providing proper leadership and oversight over long term strategic performance . The Board Composition scores enable investors to assess how well a board is positioned to provide diverse perspectives and supervision of management , as well as to assess potential risks in the current board structure . The quantitative model is designed by Bloomberg governance specialists and utilizes Bloomberg's management and board level data . The scores rank the relative performance of companies across four key focus areas of diversity , tenure , overboarding and independence . The ES scores provide a data-driven measure of corporate environmental and social performance that investors can use to quickly evaluate performance across a range of financially material , business-relevant and industry-specific key issues , such as climate change and health and safety , and assess company activities relative to industry peers . Bloomberg's proprietary quant model is informed by sustainability and industry frameworks , research and analysis to reduce noise , normalize data , address size bias , and disclosure gaps . Bloomberg's ESG scores are fully transparent . Investors can examine both the scoring methodology and the company reported data underlying each score . In addition to ESG scores , Bloomberg provides a number of sustainable finance solutions , offering data-driven insights to help investors integrate ESG throughout the full investment process .

The new tool is a diagnostic clinical score that is used to determine whether patients with the virus are at increased risk of developing the condition , known as hyperinflammatory syndrome , also sometimes referred to as a \"cytokine storm.\" This condition causes the immune system to react in an inappropriate and excessive way causing damage to organs . Diagnosing this hyperinflammatory syndrome is very important . With the new scoring diagnostic criteria , clinicians can now identify patients early and ideally prescribe treatments before the condition progresses and causes patients to deteriorate to critical levels . Researchers studied the accuracy of the diagnostic tool as part of a new study that is published in today's issue of the British medical journal , The Lancet Rheumatology . For the study , researchers applied the new cHIS diagnostic score to 299 patients admitted to Intermountain hospitals with severe COVID-19 . They found that that the criteria accurately identify patients who are at high risk for deteriorating clinically and requiring high oxygen supplementation , going on the ventilator or dying . Researchers also found that COVID-19 patients with elevated cHIS criteria were four times more likely to progress to need the ventilator for respiratory support . \"The prognostic value of the cHIS score is important because it can help doctors identify patients who are at risk of progressing to much more severe disease before it happens,\" said Brandon Webb , MD , an infectious diseases physician at Intermountain Healthcare and principal investigator of the study . Samuel Brown , MD , critical care physician at Intermountain and co-investigator on the study , says the knowing which COVID-19 patients who are vulnerable to hyperinflammatory syndrome , will also help enhance treatment in other ways . \"The cHIS score is also important in two other ways,\" explained Dr . Brown . \"First , it will help us to design clinical trials targeting the patients for whom new drugs are most likely to work , and secondly , it allows us to now tailor our treatment strategy to give the right drugs to the right patients who are most likely to benefit.\" In an accompanying editorial published with the study in The Lancet Rheumatology , written by Drs . Randy Cron , Grant Schulert , and Rachel Tatersall , they praised the work done by the Intermountain team . \"Dr . Webb and colleagues are the first to report cytokine storm syndrome clinical criteria specific to COVID-19 in the form of cHIS,\" the editorial said . \"Importantly , these criteria are relatively standard assessments that are readily available , timely ,\n",

Diverse vendors often find it difficult to become prime contractors because access to affordable capital and qualifying for bonding stand as barriers . Cayemitte Capital Management will provide sureties and lenders with the risk mitigation needed to comfortably bond and lend funds for DASNY projects . \"Without strong financial presentation and funds management skills , diverse businesses are at a disadvantage as compared to majority contractors . CCM was developed to help level the playing field,\" explains David Cayemitte , President of TCG . With the challenges smaller firms face due to the pandemic , implementing new means of support has become crucial to their survival .

Cayemitte , President of The Cayemitte Group CCM provides a unique solution to an age-old problem in the construction contracting industry in general and for the MWBE/SDVOB community in particular . CCM enhances the contractor's toolbox as they prepare to work as primes by facilitating access to affordable capital , protecting project funds and mitigating lender and surety risk . \"CCM shores up back office operations while teaching best practices in financial management\" explains Cayemitte . Providing cutting edge support has kept DASNY at the forefront of optimizing diverse procurement . Michael Clay , Senior Director of Procurement and Opportunity Programs at DASNY explains \"our decision to provide an option for bidders to utilize Capital Management services will be a game changer at increasing diverse spend.\" TCG was selected after responding to a rolling DASNY Request for Qualifications . DASNY President and CEO Reuben McDaniel , III , said \"DASNY is committed to supporting the MWBE/SDVOB business community , and to having the partners we work with reflect the diversity of New York State.\" Mr . Cayemitte began working with Mr . Clay and DASNY in 2009 when they designed the groundbreaking DASNY Surety Bond and Capital Access Program . Cayemitte has since expanded his vision of contractor capacity building , saying \"in addition to our work in the classroom , contractors need hands-on real-life experience.\" Transitioning to work in the public arena can be a nonstarter without proper funding and skills . \"Many contractors don't know what they don't know and try to figure it out on their own . In the finance area , this can be a death sentence\" Cayemitte explained . \"Small business owners are usually stretched too thin to reinvent the wheel .

The global heat pump market by revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 8% during the period 2019-2025.The global heat pump market size by revenues will cross over $92 billion by 2025 , growing at a CAGR of 8% during the forecast period . The industry is expected to grow more than 1.6X times in terms of revenue during the forecast period . The market witnessed reasonable growth in 2019 where over 50% of the contribution came from established markets such as China , the US , and Japan . The global heat pump market is expected to witness sudden traction in demand in 2021 after the downfall of the market in 2020 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic . The market growth was sluggish in Q1 and Q2 of 2020 owing to the entire disruption in the supply chain . The majority of manufacturers operated with limited resources and a workforce that highly affected the market.The district heating concept , which is increasingly favored in recent times , is expected to make the use of heat pumps as a major source . Heat is also expected to be generated from geothermal and biomass solutions . Rebate systems in several European countries have played a major role in large-scale adoption . The growth of green buildings and strong building conduct codes are other supporting factors that can stimulate the growth of heat pumps during the period 2020-2025.Global Heat Pump Market SegmentationThe global heat pump market research report includes a detailed segmentation by product type , power source , application , and geography . Air source heat pumps were the dominant segment in 2019 and constituted over 70% of the total market share . The major factor driving the installation of these pumps is high-energy efficiency , which is proven to save a minimum of 3,000 kWh per year than other conventional methods . Another major factor driving growth is the increasing adoption of ductless pumps in renovation projects . As the majority of air source heat pumps are designed to accommodate and run through the energies obtained from solar or wind energy , the product is considered as an ideal choice for achieving 100% sustainability for the welfare of the environment . The segment constitutes air-to-air and air-to-water pumps , which are likely to scale new heights in revenue during the forecast period.The less than 10 kW segment dominates the market on account of the extensive usage of heat pumps in the residential segment . Majority of homes under 3,500 sq . ft consider these heat pumps as ideal with affordable cost and installation . APAC is the fastest-growing region for the segment owing to the concentration of under-penetrated and growing economies . North America\n"

( NASDAQ: SILC ) , a leading provider of networking and data infrastructure solutions , today announced that it has achieved three new uCPE device wins with top-tier telcos , representing a combined revenue potential of approximately $10 million per year once steady-state delivery levels are reached . These wins are the result of ongoing fruitful cooperation between Silicom and a leading SD-WAN software vendor , which began two years ago when both companies identified the huge potential in combining the capabilities of Silicom's latest generation hardware CPEs with the partner's software-based disaggregated routers .

Since then , joint marketing efforts have accelerated , leading to the three current telco wins . In each of these cases , the potential for Silicom extends beyond the deals themselves .

      "Processing sentence: Ransomwiz from Nyotron Lets Cyber Pros Build Safe Ransomware Attacks Free Online Tool Puts Good Guys in the Hacker's Shoes to Test Defenses SANTA CLARA , Calif. , Sept . 21 , 2020 / / Nyotron , provider of the industry's first automatic Endpoint Detection and Response ( EDR ) with integrated prevention , today announced the release of Ransomwiz , a free online tool that empowers security teams with the ability to challenge their security products against ransomware . Ransomwiz allows security professionals to take the attacker's front seat , and generate actual ransomware samples using a variety of real-world attack techniques . Hackers have been unleashing ransomware attacks for years , and the problem is only growing . According to Verizon's 2020 Data Breach Investigations Report , ransomware is the third most common malware breach , accounting for approximately 20% of such attacks . The problem is exacerbated by the easy availability of ransomware from marketplaces and forums , and the growing remote workforce that has drastically increased the attack surface . The launch of Ransomwiz follows Nyotron's announcement late last year of RIPlace , a unique evasion technique that enables cyberattackers to maliciously encrypt files under the radar of existing anti-ransomware , EPP and EDR products . Ransomwiz is a robust platform designed for the use of IT and security professionals who are looking to evaluate and improve their security posture , as well as for educational purposes . The platform shines a light on the attacks and distribution methods hackers use . Ransomwiz is easy to understand and can be used by even the most junior security personnel . Users only need to select a directory to encrypt and choose which ransomware sample to run . Advanced customization features include overwrite options and the ability to select the rename and RIPlace method of distribution . \"The battle against ransomware can only be faced head-on by giving enterprises the awareness and tools to first understand and then properly defend against these types of attacks,\" said Nir Gaist , Founder and CTO of Nyotron . \"Before we announced RIPlace last year , we informed many vendors of the potential disaster that could occur . Unfortunately , almost a year after , most security products are still exposed to RIPlace , as well as to endless other techniques - which is why we felt the need to launch Ransomwiz and give security teams a way to do their own diligence and simulate attacks.\" Ransomwiz is now available to the public and can be accessible at ransomwiz.gg . About Nyotron: Nyotron pioneers a new generation of automatic Endpoint Detection and Response with integrated protection called Endpoint Prevention and Response ( EPR ) . Nyotron's PARANOID prevents damage caused by malware that evades existing security layers and offers granular visibility into the attack . Based on the OS-Centric Positive Security , PARANOID automatically whitelists trusted operating system behavior and rejects everything else . Its real-time protection doesn't rely on a SOC team or alert handling overhead . No manual threat hunting , baselining\n"

It is a testament to the team and the power of the Axis platform . The company is rising at the right moment and we are humbled to become their partner at such a pivotal time.\" The new funding will drive Axis' continued development of its Zero Trust platform and expansion outside of North America , while enabling further investment in go-to-market resources , including an expanded channel program and team .

      "Processing sentence: Gold and Silver Explorers are Bringing in More Funding Than Ever Amid the Gold Run FN Media Group Presents Microsmallcap.com Market Commentary NEW YORK , Sept . 22 , 2020 / / As gold prices near all-time highs , mining companies are finding more opportunities for funding than they have seen in years . Mining companies raised a total of $1.48 billion in August according to BMO Capital Markets , making August 2020 the biggest month for mining funding in more than six years . Investors are looking to capitalize on the ongoing gold run by throwing money at gold explorers and producers with prime mining assets that are set up for big returns . This past month was packed with examples of junior and intermediate receiving non-brokered private placements and bought-deal financings , with major investments heading to companies like Blackrock Gold Corp . ( TSX-V: BRC ) ( OTCQB: BKRRF ) , PureGold Mining Inc . ( TSX-V: PGM ) , Orefinders Resources Inc , ( TSX-V: ORX ) , StrikePoint Gold Inc . ( TSX-V: SKP ) ,and First Mining Gold Corp . ( TSX: FF ) . Blackrock Gold Corp . ( BRC.V ) ( BKRRF.QB ) Receives Major Investment From Billionaire Eric Sprott Blackrock Gold Corp . announcedon August 4 that the company had closed a C$7.5 million private placement , led by a C$5 million investment from billionaire businessman Eric Sprott . The private placement was previously announced on July 22 . As per the company's announcement , Sprott received a total of 10,416,667 shares in Blackrock at a price of C$0.72 per share . Blackrock Gold Corp . intends to put this funding to use for exploration on the company's impressive Tonopah West property and for general working capital . Sprott's interest in Blackrock Gold Corp . ( BRC.V ) ( BKRRF.QB ) likely has a lot to do with the company's control over more than half of the Tonopah Silver District , one of the most desirable mining districts in the state of Nevada . As the last great silver district to be discovered in the state in 1900 , Tonopah has produced more than 174 million ounces of gold and 1.8 million ounces of silver .

Guy Wates , Director of Operations and Programmatic for Measure Protocol , said , \"Data-rich industries like market research are facing ongoing challenges that affect data quality , with poorly implemented automation in the industry , dismal user experience , and extremely low compensation rates just to name a few . We wanted to test how these newer approaches based on building trust with the consumer could impact quality . By using the right technology can consumers and businesses come to trust each other again?\" Measure conducted a research initiative around quality across its own mobile-only network and also across three other prominent data collection networks that provide access to survey participants . The questionnaire was built with a combination of standard questions used in the industry to gauge quality and a number of questions specifically adapted to our approach . The research was conducted in each network at the same time to control for any timing effects . The samples were also controlled by age and gender to ensure adequate comparison of results across sources . The result is \"Is trust the solution to dirty data?\" which explores study results and sets out a guideline for defining quality , trust and future research .

      "Processing sentence: Newton Group Gains Favorable Court Ruling Against Diamond Resorts PHOENIX , Sept . 18 , 2020 / / Newton Group , an industry leader in timeshare exit , received a favorable ruling as a federal court recently denied an argument by Diamond Resorts that a Newton Group advertisement was \"literally false.\" In the July 31 , 2020 ruling , the federal court denied Diamond's motion for summary judgement by stating that Diamond Resorts failed to meet its burden of proving that the advertisement is false . Diamond Resorts asked the Court to find that a Newton Group mail piece stating that timeshare owners \"may be affected by new Timeshare Laws allowing developers to raise maintenance fees with no restriction\" was literally false . Diamond contended that the mailer is \"literally false\" because timeshare developers are not permitted to raise maintenance fees and because there have been no laws that permit maintenance fees to be raised without restriction . However , in response , the Newton Group presented evidence to the Court showing that the law does permit developers such as Diamond Resorts to raise maintenance fees , and that certain maintenance fees may be raised without restriction , as evidenced by a publication made by Diamond Resorts itself wherein Diamond advises consumers that certain maintenance fees may be raised without limitation . Specifically , Diamond informs consumers that: \"[T]he only limit on any increase in Assessments for Collection Costs is the statutory general limit found in section 721.55 ( 4 ) ( h ) 2 , Florida Statutes , which prohibits the total Assessments for Collection Costs from exceeding 125% of the total Assessments for the preceding fiscal year . This prohibition does not apply to the assessments levied by the Component Site Owners Associations.\" The reference to \"Assessments\" is another way of saying maintenance fees; and by saying that the prohibition ( synonymous with \"restriction\" ) does not apply to assessments made by Component Site Owners Associations , Diamond is admitting that there is no restriction on the ability to raise maintenance fees on certain timeshares . In other words , while there is a cap prohibiting certain maintenance fees from being raised more than 125% from the prior year , that restriction does not apply to other types of assessments ( including maintenance fees ) charged by certain resort associations to timeshare owners . Notably , the federal court stated that it did not have to reach the issue of whether the mailer was true because Diamond Resorts failed to meet its initial burden of presenting evidence \"there were no new timeshare laws anywhere in the United States that allowed a timeshare developer to increase maintenance fees without restriction.\" The federal court's rejection of Diamond's request to find that the mail piece was literally false , throws cold water on Diamond's publicity stunt in which it insists the advertisement is \"undeniably false.\" Diamond's unjustified smear campaign against the Newton Group is illegitimately designed to confuse and scare consumers from seeking third party assistance when seeking to terminate timeshare ownership .\n",

      "Processing sentence: Animal Genetics Market Size Worth USD 9.66 Billion By 2027 | CAGR of 5.2%: Emergen Research VANCOUVER , BC , Oct . 13 , 2020 / / The GlobalAnimal Genetics Marketis projected to reach USD 9.66 billion by 2027 , according to a recent report by Emergen Research . With the help of genetic modification practices that have developed rapidly in recent years , the breeding of animals with other breeds has amplified , thereby attracting investments from all major consumers on the global level . The placental mammal farmers area unit is achieving high milk-and meat-production by leveraging animal genetic technology . With the assistance of strategic breeding , the placental mammal farmers have been able to bag comparatively higher gains that are likely to drive the growth of the end-user base of the market . Besides this , the high status of animal-borne sickness transmission to humans has been a push for the animal health business from central authorities to formulate effective medicine for animals . With the growing influence , animal testing is likely to increase across all the analyzed regions in which the market has its presence . However , the cost-prohibitive nature of animal testing , together with a lack of complete professionals , may limit the otherwise steady rate of growth of the animal biology market . Request free sample of this research report at: https://www.emergenresearch.com/request-sample/92 Key Highlights From The Report Within the genetic materials segment , embryos are of utmost importance for the modification of live animals . This can be attributed to the fact that they have relatively high efficiency over semen . Several livestock farmers have also noted an increase in the reproduction rate among bovine animals , thereby indirectly influencing their profitability . There has been a prevalence of various macroeconomic and microeconomic aspects that are boding exponential growth for the Asia Pacific animal genetics market . Macroeconomic factors like conurbation and high population density are perpetually pressurizing food producers to fulfill nutritional demand by increasing the assembly rate of livestock animals . On the other hand , the animal healthcare ecosystem has been proliferating , which is unfolding opportunities for players within the animal genetics market to develop effective animal testing procedures . In 2018 , to associate degree animal genetic and make a specialty of genetic evaluations and knowledge management for cattle-breeding organizations , Neogen acquired Livestock Genetic Services , an animal genetics company . With the help of the acquisition , Neogen enhanced in-house genetic analysis capabilities and expanded the company's international network of animal genetic science laboratories Key participants include Genus Plc; Envigo Corporation , Topigs Norsvin , CRV Holding B.V , Groupe Grimaud La Corbiere SA , Hendrix Genetics BV , Neogen Corporation , Zoetis , Inc , URUS , and Animal Genetics , Inc . among others . North America is projected to retain its dominance at intervals across the worldwide animal genetic science market through the forecast period , on account of the high demand for beef and poultry food products .

We were proud that many of our priorities were reflected in the Advancing American Kidney Health initiative when it was first proposed last year; and are even more excited that many of those proposals are becoming reality today . \"The End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) Treatment Choices Model finalized by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation ( CMMI ) today will dramatically increase the ability of patients to access kidney transplant and home dialysis , which are essential steps toward improving patient centric kidney care . \"Kidney transplant is the gold standard treatment for kidney failure for most patients , providing better health outcomes , an improved quality of life , and cost savings when compared to dialysis .

Although kidney transplant and home dialysis are preferred by most patients , both are underutilized . \"Nearly 90 percent of patients whose kidneys have failed begin their treatment in dialysis facilities and many are unaware that a kidney transplant or dialyzing at home are even options .

The policies , which will increase the income eligibility threshold for assistance from the National Living Donor Assistance Center ( NLDAC ) and allow for more categories of expenses to be reimbursed by the program , are essential steps in increasing patient access to kidney transplant by providing more support to living donors . \"In January , 2019 , NKF released a comprehensivepath forward for increasing kidney transplantation.Many of our recommendations were integrated into the Advancing American Kidney Health initiative including proposals to expand financial assistance\n",

      "Processing sentence: Silverman & Roedel , LLC Offer Tips on Dealing With Car Accidents Involving Uninsured Drivers CLIFTON , N.J. , Sept . 24 , 2020 / / In most cases , when you are in an auto accident , it is either your insurance company or the insurance company of the responsible party that covers your costs . However , according to the attorneys at Silverman & Roedel , LLC , things can get complicated if one , or both , drivers are uninsured . Every state in the United States requires insurance of some form to operate a motor vehicle . This means that both parties may be subject to legal consequences and fines if they are involved in a car accidentwith no auto insurance . Things can get complicated when one , or both , drivers are injured and neither is insured . In most cases , it will come down to who is at fault for the accident . This might include: Driving under the influence Distracted driving Failure to follow local laws and road signs Aggressive driving If one of the drivers is found to be negligent , then they may be personally liable for the damages they caused . Sometimes , the uninsured driver who is clearly at fault might attempt to offer the other driver cash in hopes of making the case go away . This is never a good idea . Injuries suffered from a motor vehicle accidentcan be extensive and expensive . If you fail to document your injuries , then you will be unable to collect any compensation for complications that arise from the injury later on . Additionally , if an uninsured driver caused extensive property damage , you could be left paying for the repairs out of pocket . If you have an auto loan on the vehicle , it is even possible that you will end up paying on a vehicle that you cannot drive . Important Steps to Take After an Uninsured Auto Accident If you are involved in an uninsured auto accident , whether you or the other driver is uninsured , you will want to take the following steps: Consult with a personal injury lawyer: Auto accidents that involve uninsured drivers can get complicated . It is important to consult with a lawyer that is familiar with the local laws . Seek medical care: It doesn't matter if the other driver is uninsured , it is still important to document any injuries . However , in order to collect compensation , you will need to demonstrate an actual injury occurred . Additionally , one or both health insurance policies may cover bodily injuries . Collect all documents: It is necessary to identify liability in an uninsured auto accident case . It can be helpful to your case to begin collecting documents like medical records , police report , and witness statements .

SANTA MONICA , Calif. , Oct . 6 , 2020 / / The pursuit of an effective therapeutic intervention for dementia has inspired interest in the class of medications known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) . TKIs demonstrate potential to reduce inflammation , improve disposal of damaged cells and accelerate the removal of the toxic proteins that accumulate with dementia and related disorders . More recently , it has also been suggested that this class of drugs may inhibit the initial aggregation of toxic proteins that cause such disorders in the first place . Continue Reading Dr . Sheldon Jordan , Neurologist and Director , The Regenesis Project In Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases , there is an abnormal accumulation of toxic proteins which cause the nerve cell to shrink and become dysfunctional . In Alzheimer's disease , it's tau proteins which accumulate in structures called neurofibrillary tangles . Sheldon Jordan , M.D. , Chief Investigator for The Regenesis Project , conducted a multi-institutional study to evaluate the effectiveness of one TKI in particular , bosutinib in treating early forms of dementia . This study specifically used a Pfizer drug , Bosulif ( generic name bosutinib ) which was previously approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for the treatment of chronic leukemia . In collaboration with Dr . Santosh Kesari at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute , an affiliate of Providence Health Systems , and a number of independent neurological clinics , thirty-one patients with probable Alzheimer dementia or Parkinson spectrum disorder with dementia completed 12 months of bosutinib therapy and an additional 12 months of follow-up . Initially , the study was designed to see if TKIs such as bosutinib could prevent further memory loss or a worsening of dementia over time . Surprisingly , Bosulif actually produced a significant improvement by an entire level of dementia on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale , ( as estimated by the Quick Dementia Rating System [QDRS] ) in almost half the subjects taking this drug over the course of one year . Further investigation of bosutinib as a therapeutic agent for dementia will be conducted by The Regenesis Project.For more information on this study , please refer to research published in the September , 2020 , online issue of Neurology Clinical Practice , an official journal of the American Academy of Neurology or visit www.neurologysantamonica.com.Media Contact: Victoria Venkatraman 310-829-5968 [emailprotected]SOURCE The Regenesis Project Related Links http://www.neurologysantamonica.com\n"

To pave with the clinical failures , researchers have developed and evaluated bispecific therapeutic antibodies , that are combination of two binding specificities leading to improve selectivity as well as efficacy of antibody-based treatment for cancer . The arrival of bispecific antibody for cancer treatment has estimated to be of great potential for wide range of applications in cancer treatment . The current biotherapeutic market for cancer treatment and prevention is estimated to be dominated by antibody drugs , where bispecific antibody represents a novel ally for the next-generation of cancer therapy . In the past few years , the remarkable progress that has been made with respect to understanding the important hallmarks of the cancer progression and main epitopes involved in it have led to paradigmatic development in the bispecific antibody capable of offering novel promises to the patients who haven't respond to any medical therapy for cancer . The practice of bispecific antibody is not new i.e . this version of cancer therapeutics is a modified version of monoclonal antibody . By observing the increasing incidence of cancer , the management associated with the bispecific antibody has started to develop several strategies important for clinical management of the cancer in the present and in the future . As per the analysis conducted , it is estimated that the bispecific antibody therapeutics market is growing at a double-digit rate , thus boosting the overall cancer therapeutics market to extreme , especially when compared with other immunotherapies . Further , trends and opportunities coupled within the market i.e . rise in the number of cancer cases , government favorable policies and many others are tending to drive the growth of the market . In our viewpoint , novel alliances developed by major key players of the market and local manufacturers are estimated to be playing important role for delivering tremendous opportunities for the researchers , patients , stakeholders and the payers .

      "Processing sentence: Pandemic paradox: Global housing markets continued to surge strongly upwards during the year to Q2 BRISTOL , United Kingdom , Sept . 2 , 2020 / / In Global Property Guide's report on global housing markets , during the year to Q2 2020: View PDF Global House Prices Surge Following Pandemic Sep 2020 Surprisingly , global housing markets remained vibrant during the year to Q2 2020 , especially in Europe , Canada and the US . Real house prices ( i.e. , prices adjusted for inflation ) rose in 33 out of the 49 world's housing markets which have so far published housing statistics . The more upbeat nominal figures , more familiar to the public , showed house price rises in 38 countries , and declines in only 11 countries . This is happening despite transaction volumes suffering an enormous hit from lockdowns and travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 outbreak . The most likely explanation is lower interest rates . Many central banks compensated for weak economies through lower interest rates and quantitative easing . Quarter-on-quarter figures during Q2 confirm the trend . Strong house price surges have taken place in European countries , such as Turkey , Germany , Slovak Republic , Estonia , as well as Portugal . Despite being the new epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak , the U.S . housing market remains surprisingly robust . The S&P/Case-Shiller seasonally-adjusted national home price index rose by 3.62% during the year to Q2 2020 ( inflation-adjusted ) , an improvement from the previous year's 1.57% growth . The Federal Housing Finance Agency displayed an even more rosy picture ( from the seller's perspective ) with its seasonally-adjusted purchase-only U.S . house price index rising by 5.02% y-o-y in Q2 2020 ( inflation-adjusted ) , up from the previous year's 3.34% growth and the biggest increase since Q4 2015 . Thirty-four of the 49 surveyed housing markets showed stronger momentum in Q2 2020 compared to the previous year . Momentum is a measure of the \"change in the change\"; simply put , momentum has increased if a property market has risen faster this year than last ( or fallen less ) . Recently , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) revised its 2020 forecast for the global economy to a contraction of 4.9% , down from its earlier projection of a 3% decline . The agency predicts that all regions of the world will experience negative growth this year . Despite the significant economic slowdown , recent trends suggest the rises in housing markets will continue . The boost to asset values as a result of quantitative easing appear to be outweighing the negative economic impact of the crisis . The strongest housing markets in our survey during the year to Q2 2020 included: Turkey ( +11.59% ) , Makati CBD , Philippines ( +11.52% ) , Germany ( +10.85% ) , Slovak Republic ( +9.13% ) , and Estonia ( +8.28% ) , using inflation-adjusted figures.The biggest y-o-y house-price declines were in Egypt ( -17% ) , Pakistan\n",

While many parents will welcome the new school year , few will pay much attention to this federal holiday other than attending socially-distanced barbeques or taking last-minute getaways . What few Americans remember , however , is that Labor Day is not solely meant as a day of fun and recreation , but rather as a day of commemoration for the contributions of workers who for hundreds of years have helped America succeed . Continue Reading The Ellis Island Medals of Honor ceremony . The next ceremony will be held May 15 , 2021 on Ellis Island . Nasser J . Kazeminy , Chairman of the Ellis Island Honors Society The modern American labor movement began at the turn of the 19th century , just as immigration to the New World was reaching its peak . In the 1880s , the Pullman Company actively sought out immigrant and African-American workers to run its namesake railroad cars . In 1893 , after years of poor working conditions and a severe pay-cut , Pullman workers organized the first workers union , and soon after , America's first workers strike . Over 30 Union men lost their lives fighting on behalf of their fellow laborers . This cycle would be repeated in the Coal Strike of 1900 , where dozens more were killed fighting for a fair wage and their shot at the American Dream . Ultimately , their efforts caught the attention of the American public who soundly backed the workers in their fight . Since the 1900s , dozens of workers' rights we enjoy today were fought for and arbitrated through workers unions . These include laws against child labor , 8-hour workdays , overtime pay , minimum wages , safer working conditions , and sick leave . Prior to labor reforms , workers , both immigrant and native , suffered 70-hour work weeks under dangerous conditions , while scions of industry-built empires of wealth . These immigrants built our national parks and highway systems , the Transcontinental Railroad , New York City Subway System , and many of our homes , schools , and places of worship . Unfortunately , today , many immigrants still suffer from workplace exploitation and institutionalized racism . This is why celebrating and highlighting the achievements of immigrants remains crucial .

AGOURA HILLS , Calif. , Oct . 1 , 2020 / / LiefMed CBD Products has partnered with FireOrganixto produce the world's first water-soluble CBD dog treat Vitality+ . Vitality+ combines the health benefits of water-soluble CBD from organic hemp with Chaga mushrooms to create a pet chew that sets a new standard in pet wellness . Continue Reading LiefMed Pet Wellness Chews made with water-soluble hemp The Chaga mushroom , often called \"the gift from god,\" is found in the frigid birch forests of northern Europe , Asiaand America . It has been used by native tribes for thousands of years , who relied upon it to help them survive the harsh conditions of their brutal environment.Chaga is an incredible source of anti-oxidants , amino acids , digestive aids , and vitamins B2 , B3 , D2 , and K1 . FireOrganix specializes in the production of high-quality water-soluble ingredients made from certified hemp-derived cannabinoids . The company provides a wide range of ingredients to wholesale companies seeking to produce the most effective CBD products for consumers . \"Water-solubility was the key in selecting a CBD partner for this product,\" said Justin Daly , CEO , LiefMed . \"Dogs' bodies are made up of 60-80 percent water . Hemp is naturally an oil , so many products that deliver hemp in an oil format have limited absorption , which means less bioavailability . We have worked with FireOrganix to source water-soluble CBD for other products and knew they could deliver.\" \"Our proprietary Water-Soluble Technology ( WST ) reduces the size of the CBD molecules so they can more quickly be absorbed by the bloodstream . This ultimately means a better , more effective product for humans and pets,\" said Britt Johnson , Founder and CEO , FireOrganix . \"Consumers looking for quality appreciate science , and we are proud to be a part of the LiefMed portfolio.\"The addition of superfood Chaga , makes Vitality+ truly unique . \"Our Chaga comes directly from Alaska and is wild , harvested from Native Inuit land using sustainable practices . It is only harvested in winter and is removed without damaging the core , allowing the individual conk to regrow,\" added Daly . LiefMed Vitality+ pet treats are 100% plant based , non-GMO , and contain no preservatives or fillers .

Hundreds took part in the plasma donations that month . Earlier this week , the Korean Center for Disease Control released a statement thanking the Shincheonji Church for its help and requesting its cooperation for another round of large-scale plasma donations: Continue Reading Shincheonji Collaborates with Korean Government for Large-Scale Plasma Donations towards COVID-19 Research During this situation where the whole world is at risk due to COVID-19 , we thank Shincheonji Church of Jesus ( Chairman Lee Man Hee ) for actively cooperating with the needed group collection of plasma for coronavirus treatment research in July . Currently , COVID-19 cases have been resurging , and there is a request for the rapid development of a treatment by employing group collection of plasma . Thus , we desire to collect plasma through your organization and request for your active collaboration . Affected Shincheonji members in Daegu agreed to donate , and a facility was set up for over 1,100 donors to donate plasma between August 26th and September 4th , 2020 . Unfortunately , South Korea is currently facing its second and largest major COVID-19 outbreak . Pastor Jun Kwang-hoon of Sarang Jeil Church in Seoul , a vocal opponent of South Korean President Moon , skirted government opposition and public health concerns to hold a large rally against Moon . Pastor Jun Kwang-hoon spoke to the crowd without a mask despite having the coronavirus . The outbreak that occurred at the Sarang Jeil Church was at least ten times the size of the outbreak at Shincheonji's branch church in Daegu six months before . Sarang Jeil joins a growing number of protestant churches that are refusing to comply with the government mandate.This recent outbreak recalls the earlier outbreak in February at Shincheonji Church's branch in Daegu . However , while other religious groups opposed government orders , Shincheonji Church has constantly complied and helped the government in its efforts to combat COVID-19 . When the COVID-19 outbreak occurred at Shincheonji's branch church in Daegu , the government followed protocol by requesting church members' personal information for contact tracing . Shincheonji Church provided the information of Daegu church members immediately , as well as an updated list the following day.Although Shincheonji officially halted all church meetings and gatherings as soon as the outbreak occurred , public outrage was sparked at the news of the outbreak; rumors and worries went around that Shincheonji members were spreading the virus on purpose . Sensationalistic headlines that combined the public's fear of a \"cult\" with its fear of the coronavirus sent the public into a frenzy . The Korean Government then requested a third list , this time containing Shincheonji Church's full membership domestically and internationally , and even members-in-training .\n",

This integration enables customers to easily and securely identify and dynamically map all resources on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ( Amazon EC2 ) instances on Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) . To effectively manage entire organizations , modern enterprises must have 360-degree visibility into their cloud environments and all assets securely and dynamically with minimal manual effort . Working with AWS , BMC streamlined the overall discovery process to deliver a comprehensive topology needed for operational excellence . Prior to this innovation , operators had to open security ports to enable use of Secure Shell ( SSH ) to perform an Amazon EC2 discovery and obtain a dependency map . SSH requires multiple scans and custom security credentials per instance , resulting in a very manual and time intensive process . AWS Systems Manager enables customers to maintain a high security standard for their AWS workloads while reaping the benefits of the BMC Helix Discovery solution in managing their infrastructure and applications . \"We designed AWS Systems Manager to securely and easily enable visibility of operational data on AWS . We're excited that now , with BMC Helix Discovery , customers can get the level of detail they demand,\" said Siva Padisetty , General Manager , AWS Management Tools , Amazon Web Services , Inc . \"As organizations move toward an Autonomous Digital Enterprise , this innovative approach to discovery lets organizations modernize their operations management and manage at scale.\" The BMC Helix Discovery solution with AWS Systems Manager helps organizations realize cost savings as well as drive service and operations management efficiencies . \"To achieve service and operations excellence , it's critical that organizations have dynamic visibility into all their environments,\" said Ali Siddiqui , Chief Product Officer at BMC . \"By working with AWS , we optimized BMC Helix Discovery to provide a revolutionary way to safely and comprehensively discover everything in the environment enabling best-in-class management of the entire organization.\" The BMC Helix Suite of Solutions Delivers Intelligent Innovations for Enterprise Service and Operations Management Excellence Beyond this BMC Helix Discovery integration with AWS , BMC continues to advance the BMC Helix suite of solutions to give customers the agility , customer-centricity , and actionable insights they need to become an Autonomous Digital Enterprise .

Event Store is the company behind EventStoreDB , the popular open source event stream database.EventStoreDB was open sourced in 2012 and has relatively quietly built a strong commercial business.In late 2018 , Event Store Limited was formed and an expanded leadership , engineering , and support team were introduced.The Series A investment represents Event Store's next stage of growth towards EventStoreDB's adoption in the broader database market . EventStoreDB is an operational \"source of record\" database technology . It has similarities to event-oriented integration technologies , such as Apache Kafka , from a stream and API perspective . However , it was built for database workloads from the start.Dave Remy , Event Store CEO , explains , \"Most mainstream database technologies , whether relational , graph , or document-oriented , keep the latest state of the data , throwing away the old data when it changes . In contrast , EventStoreDB , the leader in the emerging class of databases , called Event Stores , is specifically designed to keep the changes along with the business context of those changes , in the form of events.Current state can then be derived from replaying the event stream . This pattern enables a myriad of benefits , including powerful audit , debugging , caching , occasionally connected scenarios , and much more.\" Event Stores are foundational to the increasingly popular Event Sourcing design pattern . EventStoreDB is applicable across industries and is particularly valuable for those with challenging audit requirements , such as financial services and healthcare . Innovative companies like Walmart , Xero , Insureon , Linedata , Made.com , UK National Health Service , Swiss Air Traffic Control and many more use EventStoreDB in mission-critical production environments . Building on its momentum , the company is launching Event Store Cloud , a multi-cloud database as a service ( DBaaS ) .The subscription service , currently in Preview , will provide cloud convenience and make EventStoreDB more accessible to developers and companies of all sizes . \"As applications increasingly move toward event-driven architectures , foundational platforms like EventStoreDB will be a critical first source of truth in capturing and enabling analysis of event data . This technology will generate meaningful and measurable value across multiple industries,\" said Ben Kolada , Director , Head of DataTech at ICON Corporate Finance . \"From the time Greg Young and his team released EventStoreDB in 2012 , it has been the go-to database for CQRS and Event Sourcing projects.This Series A investment represents a new stage for Event Store and EventStoreDB .

      "Processing sentence: Genome Editing Technologies Could Revolutionise Agriculture Finds IDTechEx Report BOSTON , Sept . 22 , 2020 / / 21st century agriculture is facing some major challenges . The global population is projected to increase to 10 billion by 2050 . Feeding this many people will require a 70% increase from today's global food production . However , available agricultural land is in short supply , with climate change and growing urbanization causing available arable land to decrease . The search for more land for agriculture is leading to deforestation , greenhouse gas emissions and a loss of biodiversity . IDTechEx report , Genetic Technologies in Agriculture 2020-2030: Forecasts , Markets , Technologies , www.IDTechEx.com/GeneticAgri ( PRNewsfoto/IDTechEx ) Feeding a growing population without being able to expand agricultural land will require increases in agricultural productivity . However , major crop yields have been plateauing over the last few decades and concerns over the use of synthetic pesticides and artificial fertilizers is leading to more and more tools being stripped away from farmers looking to boost their crop yields . A potential solution to these challenges is through genetics . By manipulating the genomes of crops , it is possible to make crops larger , improve resilience to environmental stresses and give plants an innate resistance to certain diseases . In a sense , humans have been manipulating the DNA of crops for thousands of years through selective breeding , although the pace has increased significantly as new genetic engineering technologies have emerged . The recent IDTechEx report , \"Genetic Technologies in Agriculture 2020-2030: Forecasts , Markets , Technologies\" , explores the use of genetic technologies within agriculture and the impact that they are having on global farming . Genetic engineering as a tool for agriculture first emerged in the 1990s , with the creation of \"genetically modified organisms\" ( GMOs ) . Creating a GMO involves a technique called transgenesis , where a segment of DNA is taken from one organism and spliced into genetic code of another . An example of this is the development of Bt corn , where the gene for producing an insecticidal protein was taken from a soil bacterium and placed into corn plants , creating a corn crop that can protect itself from insects.GMOs have been very successful in certain areas , for example over 95% of corn grown in the US is currently genetically modified . However , there are challenges . Creating a GMO is incredibly expensive , costing hundreds of millions of dollars , with regulatory approval taking decades , if the crop is even approved at all getting a GMO approved in the EU is almost impossible , for example . Additionally , GMOs have faced a hostile public backlash , which has limited their uptake in much of the world and led to harsh regulatory regimes in many places , particularly in the EU.An emerging technology that could be set to revolutionize the use of genetic engineering in agriculture is the field of genome editing . Unlike transgenics , which involves the\n",

San Francisco is the nations' melting pot for cultural diversity , serving up some of the most exquisite culinary delights in the country . However , trying to find a food truck to satisfy that craving has been a bit of a conundrum until recently . FoodTrux is launching its revolutionary app in the greater San Francisco market with direct access to well over 50 food trucks and counting . Using a smart phone or tablet , the FoodTrux app utilizes an intelligent user interface to personalize the user experience when searching for and directly engaging with food trucks based upon geographic location , culinary cuisine , and user favorites . Available on Apple'sApp Storeand Google's Google Play , FoodTrux is an interactive food truck finder app that displays local food trucks on the app's map , provides turn-by-turn directions , lists food trucks' menus , prices , special promotions and highlights regional events.All of which are uploaded in real-time on the food truck vendor side of the app . With 90% of the public possessing a smartphone and app usage rates increasing 35% in the last five years , consumers are driven by and demand functional smartphone applications designed to ease and enhance their daily lives.FoodTrux CEO , Matt Noone saw an opportunity to bridge the gap between consumer desire and food truck vendor location , placingreal-time GPS enabled food truck access in the hands of food truck foodies everywhere .

It was Bess Myerson , tall , talented , beautiful and Jewish . In spite of antisemitism and threatening calls to pageant judges warning them against selecting a Jew , Bess took the title home to her family's one-bedroom apartment in the Shalom Aleichem housing project in the Bronx . It was a victory not just for Bess , the middle daughter of struggling immigrants from Russia , but also an all-American validation for Jewish-Americans and immigrants all over the country . Continue Reading New 75th anniversary documentary film gives the behind-the-scenes story of Bess Myerson's childhood and journey to the pageant that made her Miss America 1945 An accomplished pianist and flutist , Bess Myerson tied for first place in the pageant's talent competition and won first place in the swimsuit competition yet she almost did not win the Miss America crown To celebrate the 75th anniversary of this equal opportunity milestone , award-winning filmmaker David Arond produced \"The One and Only Jewish Miss America,\" a 51-minute documentary that premieres Tuesday , September 8 , at New York City's Museum of Jewish Heritage . The film traces Bess's journey from childhood , when she thought she was ugly and gangly , through her reluctant entrance in the Miss New York City pageant , arranged without her knowledge by her sister , and her surprising Miss America victory . A concert pianist and the pageant's only college graduate , Bess Myerson represented a new kind of post-war poise , intelligence , and feminism . The film also covers Bess Myerson's heartbreak when three of the five pageant sponsors withdrew their support rather than endorse a Jew . She did not receive the promised new Ford car nor the $5,000 scholarship . However , the documentary ends on an inspiring note . After antisemitism and race-restricted hotels and venues made her drop out of her Miss America 1945 \"victory lap\" tour mid-year , she started a new educational tour . With the support of the Anti-Defamation League , she visited schools in 15 cities to promote respect for all people , regardless of race or religion . The experience led to her passion for social justice and her career in politics . \"The One and Only Jewish Miss America\" recreates the era with 1940s music , vintage photographs and film clips . Director David Arond ( PBS: \"Mother of the Year,\" \"Houseboat Philosopher,\" \"On the Internet\" series , etc. ) interviews Barra Grant , Bess Myerson's daughter and an accomplished screenwriter , and Abraham Foxman , a friend of Bess's and director emeritus of the Anti-Defamation League .

The unrelenting nature of the disease often results in the individual becoming dependent upon a power wheelchair for mobility and requiring assistance with most activities of daily living ( bathing , dressing , grooming , meal prep , ambulating , etc. ) . Presently , there is no cure for this rare progressive and degenerative disease . And as an orphan disease , funding to advance vital research is significantly lacking . Issues of importance to the LGMD community are genetic testing and identification of sub-type , support services to individuals and families coping with complex medical needs , the promotion of innovative medical research and product development , and insurance practices that assure patient access to medically necessary therapies .

Oklahoma is the last state to become compliant in the last year because of an airport enforcement deadline of October 1 , 2020 , now extended to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic . The Department of Homeland Security , and especially the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) is also congratulated on a masterful success in deploying sophisticated Credential Authentication Technology ( CAT ) scanners in all major U.S . airports that can validate REAL ID compliant IDs and passports . Brian Zimmer , President of Keeping IDentities Safe said: \"Nineteen years after the terrorist attacks on New York City and the Pentagon , the nationwide adoption of REAL ID security standards combined with TSA's readiness to enforce a deadline is a high benchmark for state and federal coordination . TSA's aggressive and effective deployment of CAT scanners , including the newest self-service stations , are accelerating the passenger inspection lines at airports . The new scanners are also catching would-be airplane passengers who present false IDs , and referring them to local police for fraud.\" Mr . Zimmer also noted: \"As of today , state and nearly all territories are finally on the same security framework baseline . However , roughly a dozen states still are way behind the level of public participation , due to their late date of compliance . Only 38% of eligible residents possess a REAL ID , and the final deadline is next October . Despite the leadership and expert guidance provided by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators , a few states do no more than the minimum required effort to persuade residents to obtain REAL IDs . These states are letting their residents down , which will impact travel and commerce when next year's airport deadline is enforced . The United States is a republic , and the states' governors hold most law enforcement authorities . Consequently , every state's governor needs to accept personal accountability to prevent future terrorist attacks from being assisted by identity fraud or manipulation at the state level.\" After October 1 , 2021 people presenting driver's licenses or state issued IDs marked as non-compliant with REAL ID issuance requirements will need to present alternative proofs of identity , such as passports or Enhanced Drivers' Licenses when boarding commercial airline flights , according to the Department of Homeland Security .

Post-consumer recycled resins or plastics are obtained by recycling the plastic waste collected from consumers . Consumer plastic waste includes bottles , films , and foams . Post-consumer plastic waste management includes recycling , recovery , and disposal of plastic waste . Moreover , waste management systems ensure the safe collection , segregation , storage , transportation , processing , and disposal of generated plastic waste . Post-consumer recycled resins also ensure that no harm is caused to the environment during this process and that the process is undertaken in accordance with the regulations and standards prescribed by governments or associations.In terms of value , recycling is estimated to lead the post-consumer recycled plastics market in 2019.Recycling , by service , accounted for the largest market share in the post-consume recycled plastics market.The recycling process of consumer plastic waste involves sorting , cleaning & drying , shredding & agglomeration , pelletizing , and finally , manufacturing recycled products.In the case of developing countries such as India , much of the waste collected from residential areas is not sorted before it is collected , which makes the recycling of consumer plastic wastes difficult.However , in developed countries , consumer plastic waste is sorted and deposited in containers; sorting also takes place after the waste is collected.In this stage , recovered plastic waste is segregated into different grades either by SPI code or by the type of plastic , additives , and fillers used . The segregation is done as different types of plastics require different treatment , while recycling them to make different types of products.PP is estimated to be the fastest-growing segment in the post-consumer recycled plastics market from 2020 to 2025.PP , by polymer type , is estimated to be the fastest-growing segment in the post-consumer recycled plastics market from 2020 to 2025 , in terms of volume.Products made from PP offer high stiffness , heat resistance , steam barrier properties ( food protection ) , elasticity ( film and fiber applications ) , enhanced transparency , strong impact & rigidity balance.The resistance of PP to permeation is equivalent to or marginally better than that of high-density polyethylene ( HDPE ) and superior to low-density polyethylene ( LDPE ) .It is recyclable and reused in\n",

The awarded funds will support basic , translational and clinical studies which will be instrumental to the understanding of this virus and its complications for those living with diabetes , both type 1 and type 2 . The 10 recipients have been provided up to $100,000 for one-year of research funding and began their research projects as of July 1 , 2020 . ( PRNewsfoto/American Diabetes Association ) \"Most of the severe disease and mortality due to COVID-19 has occurred in those with advanced age and chronic conditions , especially diabetes and cardiovascular disease . We moved thoughtfully , but very quickly , to put funding in place for 10 high-impact research studies that should pay big dividends in our understanding of how to reduce the consequences of COVID-19 in people with diabetes\" , said Robert Gabbay , MD , PhD , chief scientific and medical officer for the American Diabetes Association . \"These projects are already underway . In less than a year , I believe we'll have valuable new information that will have a real impact on the health of people with diabetes in facing this crisis.\" People with diabetes have disproportionately felt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on many levels , and we must learn more about why 40% of American COVID-19 victims have been people with diabetes , and why Americans with diabetes and other related underlying health conditions are hospitalized 6 times more often than those without . The evidence gathered so far about COVID-19 complications in people with diabetes indicates that they are at higher risk for hospitalization and for serious outcomes and death , than people without diabetes . But there is much that is unknown about why those increased risks exist , who is at greater risk , and what treatments may be particularly beneficial in reducing those risks in people with diabetes . We know that besides elevated blood glucose levels , people with diabetes have other factors such as autoimmune responses , inflammatory responses , and types of blood cholesterol that are also different from the general population . These studies will examine those and many other factors to see why diabetes is causing worse outcomes as it relates to COVID-19 and what can be done to provide better COVID-19 care for people with diabetes .

      "Processing sentence: California High-Speed Rail Faces Major Challenge from City of Millbrae MILLBRAE , Calif. , Oct . 7 , 2020 / / The City of Millbrae has filed a strenuous objection to the environmental impact report filed by the California High Speed Rail Authority ( HSRA ) , noting that the document violates the requirements of California's CEQA law . A letter from the city's legal counsel to HSRA calls the draft report \"voluminous , internally inconsistent , and unfocused on the San Francisco to San Jose segment\" of the project that would have an enormous detrimental impact on the city of Millbrae . \"Essentially , California High Speed Rails plans are to pave paradise and put up a parking lot , just like the Joni Mitchell song,\" said Millbrae City Councilmember Wayne Lee . \"We will fight them tooth and nail over their presented EIR . They should be working with Millbrae to make transit-oriented development and housing a reality . Instead , they are trying to railroad their project through with no concern for residents , approved housing , or the future of our wonderful city.\" The rail authority EIR/EIS is required to provide public officials and citizens with a clear and transparent presentation of the actual environmental impacts of this segment of the project . Instead , the draft EIR/EIS , comprising thousands of pages and appendices with their own appendices , is riddled with oversights and omissions . The document is so disorganized that , the city's letter notes , \"[p]eople reading the document particularly those residing close to ( or on ) the proposed line are forced to wade through thousands of pages to search for a straightforward explanation of the impacts of the Project\" that in most cases do not exist . Should the project proceed as planned , and without the environmental impact report and modifications required by law , it would destroy Millbrae's smart growth plans and to the city's entire future . \"The EIR/EIS is not only massive , it is massively inadequate,\" according to Millbrae City Manager Tom Williams . \"It's simply impossible for any citizen or property owner in Millbrae to locate the information they need to determine how the environmental impacts of the project might affect them or their properties . That goes against the spirit and the letter of the CEQA law and regulations.\" Said Williams The HSRA report inexplicably fails to discuss the environmental impacts of the proposed route of tracks within the city or of the development that is almost certain to occur near Millbrae Station , one of the stops on the line . Neither does the EIR/EIS offer viable alternatives that address those impacts , as required by CEQA . In one glaring example , the report ignores the fact that Millbrae has already approved and permitted a \"smart growth\" development project adjacent to the station , one that would create hundreds of environmentally responsible transit-oriented housing units . Instead , the California High Speed Rail report calls for a surface parking lot for rail passengers\n"

Volaris leads the recovery in air travel in Mexico with a solid month-on-month capacity improvement , driven by resilient VFR ( Visiting Friends and Relatives ) traffic and a large bus switching target market .

      "Processing sentence: MRC Global Announces Update to Third Quarter 2019 Revenue Estimates and Share Repurchase Program HOUSTON , Sept . 5 , 2019 / / MRC Global Inc . ( NYSE: MRC ) , the largest global distributor , based on sales , of pipe , valves and fittings and related products and services to the energy industry , today provided updated revenue estimates for the third quarter of 2019 . Due to continued reductions in customer spending levels and lower demand in the third quarter , primarily in the midstream and upstream sectors in the U.S . and the upstream sector in Canada , the company is lowering its revenue estimates for the third quarter of 2019 . Typically , the third quarter is the company's highest revenue generating quarter; however , this year is not following historical patterns . The company is now forecasting revenue for the third quarter of 2019 to be between $930 million and $950 million , a sequential decline from the second quarter of 2019 of 4.5% at the mid-point . Previously , the company expected revenue for the third quarter of 2019 to increase sequentially 2% to 4% . Given the lower third quarter estimate , revenue for the second half of 2019 is now expected to be lower than the first half of the year . The company expects current conditions to persist , and slower activity levels to continue into the fourth quarter . Given the change in the company's forecasted revenue discussed above , the most recent annual guidance provided on August 1 , 2019 no longer reflects the company's current expectations . As a result of lower customer spending levels in the second half of 2019 , the company will be implementing further operating cost reductions in the second half of the year , above the initial 125 to 150 headcount reductions previously forecasted . This will result in additional severance charges as the operating costs are aligned with a lower revenue outlook . Additionally , during August 2019 , the company purchased $13 million of its common stock at an average price of $13.59 per share . There is $12 million remaining available under the current authorization . About MRC Global Inc . MRC Global is the largest distributor of pipe , valves and fittings ( PVF ) and related infrastructure products and services to the energy industry , based on sales . Through approximately 300 service locations worldwide , over 3,500 employees and with nearly 100 years of history , MRC Global provides innovative supply chain solutions and technical product expertise to customers globally across diversified end-markets including the upstream , midstream ( including gas utilities ) and downstream ( including industrials ) .

      "Processing sentence: Family Research Council's Peter Sprigg Gives Expert Testimony Against Anchorage Therapy Ban WASHINGTON , Aug . 27 , 2020 / / Peter Sprigg , Senior Fellow for Policy Studies at Family Research Council , spent the last two nights testifying in opposition to a proposed municipal ordinance in Anchorage , Alaska , No . AO 202-65 , which would make it unlawful for any professional counselor to engage in sexual orientation or gender identity change efforts ( SOCE or GICE ) with a patient who is a minor . Sprigg delivered prepared testimony on Tuesday , August 25 . After that , he was invited by Assembly Member Jamie Allard to return as an expert witness the next night , when the Assembly took up proposed amendments and voted on final passage . The Anchorage Assembly had postponed hearing the ordinance at its July 28 meeting . In the August 26 hearing , Sprigg warned that similar bills had been struck down in Tampa , Florida and repealed in New York City in the face of successful lawsuits against them . Despite Sprigg having refuted many of the key arguments used by sponsors , the Assembly passed the ordinance late Wednesday by a vote of 9-2 . In his prepared testimony , Sprigg told members of the Anchorage Assembly ( the municipal legislative body ) that although sponsors claim that such efforts are ineffective and harmful , \"Neither of these assertions is supported by high-quality scientific evidence.\" \"In fact , evidence shows that all the elements of sexual orientation sexual attractions , behaviors , and self-identification are subject to change over time,\" Sprigg testified . In addition , \"at least six significant surveys or studies in the last twenty years . . . have shown that therapy or counseling can be effective in helping clients achieve their personal goals of change in sexual orientation.\" The only study that \"met the scientific gold standard of surveying subjects before therapy and again during and after therapy,\" and which used \"standardized measures of psychological distress,\" was one which \"showed most subjects experienced psychological improvement not harm.\" Sprigg also pointed out the tragic irony of the proposed ordinance's treatment of gender identity under which \"it would be legal to interrupt normal physical development with puberty-blocking or cross-sex hormones , and to perform surgeries that mutilate and/or sterilize a young person for life . . . . But it would be illegal for a therapist to simply talk with that young person in a way that might help him or her to become more comfortable with the body he or she was born with.\" Due to coronavirus restrictions , the Anchorage Assembly is currently not allowing members of the public to attend its meetings in person . Sprigg therefore delivered his testimony by telephone from his home in the Washington , D.C . area . On Wednesday night , Sprigg remained on the phone with the Assembly for nearly three hours , answering questions about the legislation and proposed amendments whenever they were raised .

      "Processing sentence: ESC Brands Boasts Three New Products to Kill COVID-19 , Zetrisil Is The Scientifically Proven Answer to Protect Our Children and More Safely Open Schools GREENSBORO , N.C. , Sept . 10 , 2020 / / ESC Brands is striving to assist with the safe opening of schools by better protecting children and staff from the further spread of the COVID-19 virus in the classroom environment . ESC's Zetrisil-based products have been proved as effective as alcohol-based sanitizers , with proven persistence of activity without the toxicity and flammability concerns of traditional sanitizers . Continue Reading A few of our products . ESC's Zetrisil-based technologies are a family of proprietary silicon-based virus killing agents that reduce the presence of the virus from the hands , skin surfaces , fabric , and clothing in most environments . By using a trio of safer products in combination to combat the further spread of the virus , ESC is convinced our children can return to school with minimal virus transfer between school and the home environment . Recent studies completed by the University of Alabama in Huntsville prove that Zetrisil-based products are highly effective and demonstrate persistent activity against the COVID-19 virus . ESC's FDA- & Health Canada-registered hand sanitizers show an initial 30- & 60-second virus kill rate of 99.90% , with persistence of virus-killing activity for four hours after a single initial application . The company claims its Zetrisil-based hand sanitizer is far safer and more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers . Zetrisil stays on the surface of the skin and is proven to kill the COVID-19 virus for four hours per application . In contrast , alcohol-based hand sanitizers can be absorbed into the bloodstream , are extremely flammable , and are only proven effective for a few minutes after each application . These factors make traditional alcohol-based hand sanitizers a less than optimal choice for use in children . Because Zetrisil is safer than traditional agents and remains on the skin for several hours , children are protected longer without the need for frequent applications of sanitizer.ESC's pending EPA- & Health Canada-registered surface sanitizer/disinfectant is proven to kill 99.9% of virus particles initially after a single application , with increased persistence kill of 99.99% after 30 days . These kill rates required only a single 10 min contact time against the COVID-19 virus . ESC is closely working with EPA with the N list registration process for this product.ESC's pending EPA- & Health Canada-registered Laundry Complete sanitizer/fabric softener is proven to kill 99.99% of the COVID-19 virus when used as a pre-soak or in the rinse cycle of a conventional clothes washing cycle , with the washed clothes continuing to kill 99.0% of the virus for 200 days after the initial wash . The company believes , based on these studies , that simply washing your clothes weekly can dramatically reduce the transfer from school to the home environment.Special Projects Director Angela McClure , who oversaw the UAH testing , said in a statement:\"I truly believe Zetrisil is the miracle product\n",

According to the complaint , during that time period Plantronics and certain of the Company's senior executive officers engaged in an \"illicit channel stuffing scheme designed to deceive investors into believing Plantronics' costly acquisition of audio video conferencing company , Polycom , Inc. , had transformed the stagnant headset company into an overnight growth story.\" The complaint further alleges that \"[t]he truth about Defendants' fraud was revealed through a series of disclosures between June 18 , 2019 and November 5 , 2019 , when the Company , unable to continue its channel-stuffing scheme , announced sales integration and channel consolidation issues , declining quarterly revenues , poor financial guidance and an outsized reduction of channel inventory . These disclosures caused Plantronics shares to plummet , erasing billions of dollars in market capitalization and causing investors to suffer substantial damages.\" The firm's investigation seeks to determine whether the members of Plantronics' board of directors violated the securities laws and/or breached their fiduciary duties to Plantronics and its stockholders in connection with the above alleged misconduct . Current Plantronics stockholders who purchased or acquired shares of the Company's stock prior to August 7 , 2018 are encouraged to contact Kaskela Law LLC ( D .

      "Processing sentence: Robot Shuttles Double as Robotaxis says IDTechEx BOSTON , Sept . 4 , 2020 / / As IDTechEx predicted in its report , \"Robot Shuttles and Autonomous Buses 2020-2040\" , robot shuttles are converging with robotaxis . Robot shuttles are a new type of vehicle that is limited to slow speeds for cities . Being silent , robotic and emission-free , they are expected to be allowed over piazzas and through indoor malls to deliver even children and the severely disabled right to their destination safe and dry . Cleverly , they are special boxy symmetric designs never needing to do a U-turn , so they access the tiniest spaces . They are designed to rapidly reconfigure as \"last mile\" freight carriers , mobile restaurants , school buses and more and display lucrative wide-area advertising . In contrast , robotaxis are analyzed in the IDTechEx report , \"Autonomous Cars and Robotaxis 2020-2040\" . They are autonomous , road-only taxis going fast and far for a lower cost than manned taxis due to intensive use , some being lent by private owners for part of the day . Physically they are little more than a regular car like a Tesla X . Now National Electric Vehicle Sweden ( NEVS ) has presented a mobility ecosystem for autonomous electric vehicles for sharing services , under the name PONS . At the heart of the ecosystem is the autonomous Sango electric vehicle for up to six passengers . NEVS says there is no reason to own an autonomous vehicle . PONS cheaply goes anywhere on city roads . Its new pilot project in Stockholm will operate ten Sango robot shuttles in robotaxi mode . Maximum speed is 15 km/h , later 50 km/h . However , although Toyota will use its E-Palette smart shuttles in its demonstration smart city at the base of Mount Fuji and the Tokyo Olympics , most car makers are ambivalent as both options mean less vehicles need to be manufactured . Leaders in robot shuttles are mainly new companies and they find it easy to get city and financial backing . Time will tell what is the killer concept .

The China Animal feed market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.06% over the forecast period . Concerning livestock farming , hog and sow inventory are both starting at low levels , having fallen 27% and 30% respectively from 2019's starting inventory . Due to robust restocking efforts in 2020 and fewer losses to African swine fever , the decline in herd inventory is estimated to reverse , and year-end 2020 inventories are forecast to grow by 9% . Total hogs slaughtered and pork production in 2020 is both estimated to decrease further by 24% and 20% , respectively , from the previous year . High prices will incentivize many Chinese consumers to opt for other substitute sources of proteins . Even though traditional Chinese dishes cannot substitute beef for pork , thinly sliced beef that is well renowned for hotpot will likely witness high growth in 2020 . In 2019 , China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs ( MARA ) implemented a three-year mission plan for stabilizing swine production and supply . One of the key principals of this plan is to set specific production targets on a per-province level . Specific targets of slaughtered hogs to be shipped out in 2020 were set for top wine-producing provinces including Henan , Jiangxi , Hunan , and Shandong while the hog production targets are also set for hog intake provinces/municipalities . Large companies are encouraged to assist small to medium swine farms resume operation . By the end of 2019 , MARA had implemented a program called Large Agricultural Enterprises Lead 10,000 Households on Swine Farming to Alleviate Poverty in 16 less developed cities in provinces including Hubei and Sichuan . With an investment of RMB50 billion ( $7.1 billion ) by 15 large agricultural enterprises , the program is expected to add 22 million slaughtered hogs per year [Source: USDA] . Therefore , with no signs of a decrease in consumption patterns and proactive government initiatives animal feed market of China is poised for a meteoric rise to satiate the incremental consumption pattern of the Chinese consumers . Further , another aspect of the livestock farming that is poised throttle the growth of China animal feed sector is the longer lifecycle of beef production , the overall cattle inventory will remain stable and is expected to grow with government stimulus , relaxation of environmental standards , and higher profits will possibly incentivize some larger operations to invest in long-term expansion . It is also estimated that domestic beef production will increase to 7 MMT . China's cattle herd inventory will increase by 2% to 91 million in 2020 . It should be\n"

Since it was launched in 2015 , fuboTV has revolutionized the way over-the-top ( \"OTT\" ) subscribers in America watch sports and entertainment content . Demand for fuboTV has been further boosted due to changing consumer preferences since the onset of COVID-19 . fuboTV's first day of trading on the main board of the NYSE was on 8 October 2020 . The IPO was underwritten by 7 top investment banks and the bookrunner , Evercore ISI , raised about US$180 million . Assuming a mid-point price of the IPO , fuboTV's enterprise value is US$1.5 billion . When comparing with the valuation at the time when Tsangs Group came in , Tsangs Group achieved a 50x return on this investment . fuboTV is a sports-focused live TV platform that offers a diverse range of content on SmartTVs , mobile phones , tablets , and computers . The OTT platform originally launched as a soccer streaming service; however , the platform has evolved to feature sports channels such as ESPN and Fox alongside well-known networks like Disney , ABC , FX , Nat Geo and many more . Prior to the listing in NYSE , Tsangs Group , as an early investor , provided strategic advice and assisted in financing initiatives for fuboTV by leveraging its global network . Furthermore , FaceBank Group , Inc. , Tsang Group's listed vehicle on the OTC markets , completed a merger with fuboTV on April 2 , 2020 and the combined entity was renamed as fuboTV . The merger creates a leading digital entertainment company , combining fuboTV's direct-to-consumer live TV streaming platform with FaceBank's technology-driven IP in sports , movies , and live performances . Patrick Tsang , Chairman of Tsangs Group , said: \"Congratulations to fuboTV on its successful IPO on the New York Stock Exchange . We are very pleased and excited that we invested in the company 2 years ago and we have now achieved a 50x return today on our investment in fuboTV based on enterprise value . Thank you to David Gandler , the co-founder and CEO of fuboTV , for his leadership and for his team for taking the company to such great heights . As the company moves forward , we are extremely happy to have co-investors such as Disney and Goldman Sachs alongside us.\" Looking ahead , even though the outbreak of COVID-19 has changed the way fans engage with and watch live sports , the demand for sports content is still high , which means the OTT market is expected to experience remarkable growth due to the increase in adoption of OTT services and subscribers .

SparkPost's sophisticated technology cemented the win , with a focus on its email innovation and position as a key partner in industry improvement and empowerment . Specifically , SparkPost's AMP for Email technology and its AI-powered 'Health Score' , which predicts deliverability success , were called out for their value in the B2C space . These technologies give email marketers the ability to better source and engage key consumer audiences , helping SparkPost B2C customers lean on email as an important part of the overall digital marketing program . AMP for Email: SparkPost was an official launch partner at Google I/O ( March 2019 ) when AMP ( accelerated mobile pages ) for Email was announced . AMP for Email is the ability to combine dynamic , real-time , up-to-date content and interactivity into a personalized individual experience for every Gmail recipient inside their inbox . For marketers , it means that users complete actions directly in the email rather than going off to a landing page , such as RSVPing to an event , taking a survey , verifying their email address , browsing an online catalog of your products , and more . SparkPost has been working with a leading travel booking site , a top online discovery platform , and several other clients to boost customer engagement and revenue using AMP , all the while delivering a truly seamless customer experience . AI-powered 'Health Score': Mailbox providers , such as Gmail , Outlook.com , Yahoo Mail and others want to protect their users from spammers , hackers , phishers , etc . They've built models to do this , using a recipient's historical engagement with senders' email , the email content , and many other factors in this determination .

The treatment , which the research team has used successfully in other patients with lymphatic disorders , led to a complete resolution of the patient's symptoms and fully remodeled her lymphatic system within a matter of months . The findings were recently published in EMBO Molecular Medicine . \"The resolution of lung disease with lymphatic remodeling is remarkable and potentially should change how we evaluate and treat lung disease in this patient population,\" said first author Jessica B . Foster , MD , an attending physician in CHOP's Division of Oncology . \"These results offer hope to other patients with lymphatic-induced lung disease and warrant further investigation.\" Brenna , the patient described in the paper , first developed symptoms related to KLA at age 6 and was diagnosed with the condition when she was 10 . For nearly a decade , she was treated with a variety of therapies , including rapamycin , an immunosuppressant; prednisone , a steroid; and vincristine , a chemotherapy drug . Despite aggressive treatment , her debilitating symptoms persisted , and so her clinical team at CHOP decided to explore other therapies . Many patients with KLA have a mutation in the NRAS gene , and the team had previously used a mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MEK ) inhibitor called trametinib in another patient with a severe lymphatic disorder and NRAS mutation . The drug resolved his symptoms and completely remodeled his lymphatic system . Although that patient did not have KLA , the researchers felt the success of trametinib in treating his severe lymphatic symptoms , combined with Brenna's rapidly deteriorating condition , warranted the request for expanded access to treat Brenna with the drug . As Brenna began taking trametinib , a drug historically used to treat metastatic melanoma , the researchers sent samples of her lymph fluid for genetic sequencing . The researchers learned that Brenna did not harbor an NRAS mutation and instead had a mutation in a different gene: CBL , a gene that operates along the Ras pathway , the same genetic pathway implicated in other lymphatic disorders , including the one for which they had used trametinib with great success . Mutations along the Ras pathway result in an overproduction of MEK , which leads to the uncontrolled proliferation of lymphatic vessels . A MEK inhibitor like trametinib brings the production of MEK under control , putting the brakes on a\n"

      "Processing sentence: Lens.com: FTC Begins Enforcement of the Contact Lens Rule Changes will help more patients save money on their contact lenses LAS VEGAS , Oct . 21 , 2020 / / Consumers have had the right to shop around when buying contact lenses courtesy of the Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act , which was signed into law by President George W . Bush in 2003 . Since that time , compliance within the optometry industry has been terrible , with patients continuing to report they are denied access to their contact lens prescription . The Federal Trade Commission issued revisions to the Contact Lens Rule on June 23 , 2020 and strengthened its enforcement to provide enhanced protection for patients . Effective Friday , October 16 , 2020 , optometrists are required to provide , unprompted , a copy of the contact lens prescription to the patient at the end of the contact lens fitting . This takes the onus off the patient and places it squarely on the practitioner to comply with the law . Optometrists are now required to obtain a signed receipt from the patient for the prescription , and they must retain it for three years . Optometrists cannot require patients to buy contact lenses , pay additional fees , or sign a waiver or release in exchange for their contact lens prescription . \"Since the Contact Lens Rule was enacted in 2004 , our customers have continued to report issues with getting their prescriptions from their optometrist . The team at Lens.com must verify all prescription details are accurate with the doctor's office . Some offices just do not respond to our inquiries,\" shared Lens.com President & CEO Cary Samourkachian . \"This makes it difficult for our customers to access the products they need when they need them .

During a recent Pre-NDA meeting , we identified a data package from the PERSIST-1 , PERSIST-2 and PAC203 Phase 2 trials that will serve as the basis for an accelerated approval application . In particular , we discussed risk mitigation measures to address the FDA's prior concerns regarding safety,\" said Adam R . Craig , M.D. , Ph.D. , President and Chief Executive Officer of CTI Biopharma . \"In myelofibrosis patients , severe thrombocytopenia occurs as a result of disease or drug-related toxicity from current therapies . There is no approved drug that specifically addresses the unmet need of the myelofibrosis patients who have severe thrombocytopenia .

In good times and bad , they are gathering spots for celebration and for service . During COVID , they have been where people get tested and where official information is shared . During natural disasters , such as wildfires , floods and earthquakes , they serve as shelters and emergency medical units . In this time of national catastrophe and economic uncertainty , fairgrounds have no income , and no events . And yet , they are an essential service - an essential service that needs to be part of any financial recovery and stimulus . Facing never-before-seen or anticipated loss of income , employees and resources , the Western Fairs Association ( www.westernfairs.org ) and its subsidiary California Fairs Alliance are pushing for passage of the \"Protecting Fairs During Coronavirus Act\" and the \"Agriculture Fairs Rescue Act\" . They are calling for public assistance to support the effort . Also , when posting information about the effort , the groups ask for people to magnify the message on social media with the hashtag #WFAHereToHelp . \"Fairgrounds are an essential part of the infrastructure necessary for state and local communities to effectively respond in natural disasters and emergencies,\" said Sarah Cummings , President & CEO , Western Fairs Association/California Fairs Alliance . \"Fairgrounds generate multi-millions of dollars in non-profit and community benefits , promoting agriculture and a quality of life serving as gathering spots , recreation facilities and learning centers . Now is the time to provide emergency funding and preserve the legacy of our nation's fairgrounds for future generations to come.\" On July 23 , 2020 Representative Josh Harder ( D-CA-10 ) introduced the Protecting Fairs During Coronavirus Act ( H.R . 7745 ) in response to concerns from county and state fair leaders . The bill would create a new emergency grant program to help offset the massive revenue losses our fairs are experiencing because of health care measures taken to combat the Coronavirus Pandemic . The Protecting Fairs During Coronavirus Act would establish a $5 billion federal grant program to offset fair revenue losses during the Coronavirus Pandemic . The fund would be available for both 2020 as well as 2021 . States could apply for aid from the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) and then distribute the funds to fairs in their state . On July 30 , 2020 Representative Jimmy Panetta ( D-CA-20 ) introduced the Agricultural Fairs Rescue Act ( H.R . 7883 ) . The Agricultural Fairs Rescue Act would provide $500 million in grant funding to establish a program to award grants to states or state departments of agriculture to provide support to agricultural fairs for losses sustained by fairs during the Coronavirus Pandemic . Grant amounts shall be based on the difference between the average attendance at agricultural fairs in the state for a month occurring in 2019 compared to the corresponding\n"

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) granted a New Technology Add-on Payment ( NTAP ) for the Eluvia Drug-Eluting Vascular Stent System as part of the 2021 Inpatient Prospective Payment System ( IPPS ) . The NTAP designation , awarded to new medical devices determined to substantially improve the diagnosis or treatment of Medicare beneficiaries , will be effective on October 1 , 2020 and will provide eligible hospitals with incremental reimbursement for the Eluvia stent system for up to three years . The Medicare criteria for an NTAP designation is based on newness of the device , cost and a substantial clinical improvement . The Eluvia stent system was developed for the treatment of peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) the narrowing of the arteries of the legs due to plaque buildup which affects approximately 8.5 million people in the United States and more than 200 million people worldwide.[i],[ii] Left untreated , PAD restricts blood flow to the legs and feet and patients often experience pain , swelling and a diminished quality of life . The Eluvia stent re-opens the blocked artery and restores blood flow , while also utilizing a drug-polymer combination to offer a sustained , low-dose release of drug to prevent tissue regrowth within the stented artery . \"The CMS determination is a very positive development for patients with PAD and supports what we have confirmed through our clinical trials the Eluvia stent offers clinically superior outcomes compared to other peripheral drug-coated technology available to clinicians and their patients,\" said Jeff Mirviss , executive vice president and president , Peripheral Interventions , Boston Scientific . \"The decision is particularly important given the level of consideration and evaluation related to the role of paclitaxel in the peripheral vasculature , and we believe this designation reflects the unique attributes of the Eluvia stent , which are clearly differentiated and improve the quality of life for the millions of people suffering from symptoms of PAD.\" The NTAP designation will support access to the Eluvia stent for Medicare beneficiaries in the hospital inpatient setting , making it possible for eligible hospitals to receive NTAP payment in addition to the standard Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group ( MS-DRG ) payment . The FDA approval of the Eluvia stent system in September 2018 was based on findings from the IMPERIAL trial , which exhibited the highest 24-month primary patency reported to date for the treatment of femoropopliteal disease in a U.S . pivotal trial with a drug-coated balloon or drug-eluting stent.[iii] Trial data confirmed a statistically significant lower clinically-driven target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) rate of 12.7% for patients treated with the Eluvia stent , in contrast to 20.1% observed within the Zilver PTX Drug-Eluting Peripheral Stent cohort ( p=0.0495 ) , thus reducing the need for repeat procedures at 24 months.[iv] Additional information on the Eluvia\n",

The discovery is described in Angewandte Chemie . \"You can transform a pencil lead into diamond if you squeeze it very hard\" this fact heard by many of us in childhood sounded like a complete nonsense . However , science laws make it clear that there is no miracle: both pencil lead and diamond are formed by the same chemical element , i.e . carbon , which actually forms a different crystal structure under very high pressure . It makes sense: ar pressure the empty space between atoms decreases and the material becomes denser . Until recently , this statement could be applied to any material . It turned out that a number of materials can become porous at ultrahigh pressure . Such a conclusion was made by a group of scientists from NUST MISIS ( Russia ) , Linkping University ( Sweden ) and University of Bayreuth ( Germany ) . The team examined three metals ( hafnium Hf , tungsten W , and osmium Os ) with an addition of N when placed in a diamond anvil at a pressure of 1 million atmospheres , which corresponds to a pressure at a depth of 2.5 thousand kilometers underground . Scientists believe that it was the combination of pressure and nitrogen N that influenced the formation of a porous framework in the crystal lattice . \"Nitrogen itself is quite inert and without ultrahigh pressure it would not react with these metals in any way . Materials without nitrogen would simply condense in a diamond anvil . However , a combination gave an amazing result: some of the nitrogen atoms formed a kind of reinforcing framework in the materials , allowing the formation of pores in the crystal lattice . Consequently , additional nitrogen molecules entered the space,\" said Professor Igor Abrikosov , head of the theoretical research group and NUST MISIS Laboratory for the Modeling and Development of New Materials . The experiment was initially conducted physically by Sweden and German part of the group , and then its results were confirmed by theoretical modeling on NUST MISIS supercomputer . Scientists emphasize that the research is fundamental , i.e . materials with such properties are not yet created for specific tasks . At the moment , the very fact that previously unthinkable modifications of materials can be obtained is important . A whole new step will be to preserve such materials at normal atmospheric\n",

Last year , nearly $1.6 million in HKHF grants were awarded to community-based organizations statewide . And while the key focus of the HKHF program has not changed , the COVID-19 pandemic and unrest associated with social justice initiatives in the United States , reinforces BCBSTX's focus on health equity and our core purpose to stand with our members and the communities we serve in sickness and health . \"Our long history of identifying and supporting strategic partnerships with organizations that have a shared interest in creating communities of healthy Texans has never been more important than it is now,\" said Dr .

However , the 2021 HKHF grant cycle also will include emphasis on programs that create measurable results to address the current public health pandemic and social factors exacerbating health inequalities and social determinants of health such as lack of housing , food deserts , education and jobs and mental health .

      "Processing sentence: Support Students Through Community Programs MISSION , Kan. , Sept . 3 , 2020 / / ( Family Features ) As kids prepare for the upcoming school year , school supplies remain critical to their success . While school districts struggle with the challenge of delivering education and resources to students amid a pandemic , many parents are working to determine how they will ensure their children have the necessary supplies . Photo courtesy of The Salvation Army Community youth programs are innovating to fill gaps and ensure kids from low-income families in particular are equipped with learning materials and supplies , enrichment activities and food . For example , when schools closed , local corps of The Salvation Army started adapting creative alternatives to their youth programs to provide activities , snacks and educational materials like coloring sheets , scavenger hunts and more to keep kids entertained and learning . If you'd like to make a similar impact in your community , consider lending a hand in one of these ways: Tutor or mentor students . Although most kids across the nation face the same challenges with academics , some are at more of a disadvantage because their access to remote learning resources is limited or parents are unable to assist at home . You can help by volunteering to tutor students as they practice learned skills and get back into the swing of a new school year.Donate supplies . There are 30 million children in the United States whose parents will have to choose between buying school supplies or other necessities like putting food on the table . Consider adding extra common items like crayons , markers and glue when you shop for your own children and dropping them off at your local youth center . Campaigns like The Salvation Army's \"Stuff the Bus\" events allow shoppers to purchase and drop off requested items at collection bins located at the front of participating retailers.Get involved with extracurricular activities . If you have a particular skillset or experience , for example as a high school or college athlete , lending your knowledge to a local youth group can help provide a constructive outlet for kids while enriching your own life . Volunteer for meal distribution . Many children rely heavily on schools for meals; in fact , the food some students receive through their schools' breakfast and lunch programs may be the only meals they get in a day . Across the country , organizations have partnered with local school districts to provide meal kits , coordinate food distribution routes and pickup locations to get meals to kids and families . Depending on the needs in your area , you may be able to donate food , assist with organizing the meal kits or help coordinate deliveries.Help fund youth programs . Uncertainty caused by COVID-19 has many people reconsidering their finances , and that means the donations and contributions many programs rely upon have slowed .

Software IPO Tokyo-based wealth management company Taiko Aichi Capital comments on the largest IPO of the year: Snowflake , the U.S . software company TOKYO , Sept . 22 , 2020 / / Taiko Aichi Capital , a private wealth management company headquartered in Tokyo , Japan , has commented on Snowflake as it launches the largest initial public offering ever recorded for a U.S . software company , in the latest example of Wall Street's voracious appetite for cloud computing businesses . Anthony Green , Taiko Aichi Capital's Head of Capital Markets , commented: \"Snowflake sold 28 million shares valued at $120 apiece , raising around $3.4 billion in proceeds for the company . This gives the company a market valuation of over $33 billion . \"The final share price surpassed Snowflake's targeted range of $100 to $110 , which itself was increased by more than a quarter earlier this week,\"he added . The cloud software company's market value is more than two-and-a-half times that of the $12.4 billion valuation it achieved in its last fundraising round in February . Snowflake's offering is the biggest of the year and the largest in the U.S . since Uber's $8.1 billion flotation in May last year , according to analysts at Taiko Aichi Capital . VMware , the cloud computing company , majority-owned by Dell , had previously completed the largest software IPO when it went public in 2007 . The company has drawn investors through its fast-growing base of customers who use its data warehousing product , which enables users to analyse data across multiple remote storage providers , such as Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) . Snowflake's revenue increased by 121 percent in the second quarter from the same period last year , and it boasts high \"net retention\" numbers , demonstrating customer loyalty . Thomas Henderson , Taiko Aichi Capital's Director of EMEA Wealth , commented: \"Snowflake's IPO received a significant boost last week when Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Salesforce both agreed to purchase $250 million in stock alongside the flotation . Berkshire also purchased a further $320 million from the company's previous chief executive , Bob Muglia.\" The company's listing is further evidence of the increased demand for tech firms benefiting from the shift towards remote working . The BVP Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index , which monitors cloud software companies , has gained almost 59 percent this year , more than doubling the returns of the broader tech-heavy Nasdaq Index . Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley both served as lead underwriters on the Snowflake offering .

Methodics IPLM also adds new security solutions to help companies deal with the challenges of sharing IP and addressing the security concerns around global IP leakage , which often costs companies many millions of dollars . \"Without the ability to understand where IP is being used , from designers' workspaces all the way to products being delivered , it is nearly impossible to be able to deliver solutions on time and meet product requirements,\" said Simon Butler , General Manager for Methodics IPLM . \"Without the ability to manage not only the IP but all the metadata associated with the design , teams waste time tracking down the correct version of IP and trying to track down where IP has been used in previous designs . This slows down delivery and leads to time-to-market delays.\" The new version of Methodics IPLM goes further than any other platform to manage the BoM of design assets in a SoC . With Methodics IPLM 3.0 , this capability is now extended to the planning phase of SoC design , allowing for true what-if analysis of build vs . buy vs . reuse of IP , and insight into the implications on design cost and product schedule.\"We're excited to bring these new features to market,\" continued Butler . \"The new planning BoM functionality will help semiconductor teams accelerate design , development , and delivery by managing iterations on the project plan and delivering the execution BoM to development teams.\"Additional enhancements to Methodics IPLM include improved IP analytics and performance improvements . Building on the vast metadata management layer of the IP lifecycle management platform , Methodics IPLM will allow companies to perform complex analytics such as IP cost modeling , functional safety analysis , and external threat analysis of IP functionality . Also included in the latest version of the platform are improved performance for IP sharing and distribution throughout globally distributed development teams , and the introduction of custom defined objects to facilitated the rapid prototyping and delivery of solutions.Learn more about what's new in Methodics IPLM by visiting perforce.com.About PerforcePerforce powers innovation at unrivaled scale .

      "Processing sentence: COVID-19 Validates Urgent Need for Effective Recycling System New research shows safety and hygiene taking precedent over environmental concerns; Consumer Brands shares recycling vision with Trump , Biden campaigns ARLINGTON , Va. , Sept . 1 , 2020 / / Six months of fighting against a pandemic has shifted the mindset of many environmentally conscious consumers , according to findings from a new report released today by the Consumer Brands Association . As the coronavirus causes increased plastic use , the need for a recycling system capable of accommodating this new reality also grows . The Ipsos-conducted survey of 1,016 American adults found that nearly seven-in-ten ( 69% ) Americans say they are more concerned about safety and hygiene than environmental impact . Furthermore , while an overwhelming majority ( 82% ) of Americans are concerned about the environment , the figure is down eight points from 2019 . Similarly , concern for single-use plastics , justifiably high at 80 percent , is down seven points from last year . America currently has nearly 10,000 individual recycling programs , each with unique rules that create confusion and inefficiency . Only 11 percent of respondents feel that the country's recycling systems are doing the best they can to recycle the material they receive . \"America is using more plastic and packaging to contend with COVID-19 and it is exposing our broken recycling system,\" said Geoff Freeman , Consumer Brands president and CEO . \"The pandemic has validated the urgent need for a modern recycling system that can deal with our reality . Where else can you have an 11 percent approval rating and continue the status quo?\" The pandemic has increased the volume of plastic and packaging waste , particularly single-use plastics . Consumer concern about single-use plastics is high , but a strong majority ( 62% ) agree that improving the recycling system so it can efficiently process plastic is the preferred way to deal with single-use plastic waste . Only 17 percent want to see single-use plastic bans . There is near-universal agreement that COVID-19 has raised the stakes on the importance of a functioning recycling system . Ninety-two percent of those surveyed believe recycling is now more or equally as important than before the pandemic for handling the increase in plastics and packaging . \"The first step to change is acknowledging the problem a problem that Americans clearly recognize: our current recycling system is failing,\" said Meghan Stasz , Consumer Brands vice president , packaging and sustainability . \"COVID-19 is exposing the urgent need for a functioning recycling system . While the pandemic may be behind us , before we can truly fix all aspects of American recycling , the work we undertake today will leave generations better for it.\" Consumer Brands shared its recycling vision with the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates to urge both parties to make fixing America's recycling infrastructure a key component of their environmental or infrastructure development platforms . The outreach to the campaigns builds on work Consumer Brands is spearheading through the Recycling Leadership\n",

The government had been saving US$5 million every month over the past few years from the Citizenship by Investment ( CBI ) Programme specifically for the construction of the new airport . After extensive amiable negotiations with land owners , Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit said that the government has made major progress towards the much-anticipated construction of the new airport . A group of international experts will first carry out a series of geotechnical studies in August . Besides the construction of the airport itself , the government will build new homes for some impacted residents . \"We have placed the international airport as priority number one for the Government,\" PM Skerrit said earlier this month . \"I am redirecting a lot of state resources in terms of human resources , engineers and surveyors , to the project,\" he added . Last week , the Prime Minister announced: \"Progress has been made towards the construction of the international airport . We have completed the necessary surveys and Cabinet has approved for the acquisition of 213 properties required for the airport construction , of which 47 are farms . The total market value of these properties is estimated at 50.7 million dollars . Negotiations have been completed with 25 property owners . Government will begin to make payments to the property owners and farmers in August , 2020 . Geotechnical surveys will be undertaken by September , 2020.\" Dominica is one of the least affected countries by Covid-19 and has an attractive ecotourism offering . Borders reopened for tourists on August 7th . Until the new international airport is complete , visitors can reach Dominica through connecting regional flights . Over the past few years , the government has been working with hotel developers and investors to turn Dominica into a 5-star destination . Ever since , the Nature Isle of the Caribbean has modernised its infrastructure and welcomed ultra-luxury yet environmentally-friendly resorts . It did so with funding from its reputable Citizenship by Investment Programme . Foreign investors and their families , upon passing due diligence checks , can obtain second citizenship from Dominica either by making a contribution to the Economic Diversification Fund or investing in pre-approved real estate .

These cities are the drivers of our economy and places that Americans are proud to call home . The president's outlandish depiction of them has no basis in reality . This order has no legal standing , but if it were implemented it would make cities less safe by slashing resources for police , firefighters , and first responders as well as other essential services . Families and small businesses who make cities their homes should not be used as a weapon in some political fight . This pandemic , a struggling economy , and a national awakening to the reality of systemic injustice in America all call for a time of national healing and unity , but this effort is intended only to inflame tensions and divide us .

In 2019 alone , independent primary care practices in Aledade contracts with commercial and government payers saved more than $200 million in health care spending while delivering better care to more than 620,000 Americans . New data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) show that , in 2019,Aledade's MSSP ACOs prevented 10,000 hospitalizations for Medicare beneficiaries and saved Medicare more than $180 million in unnecessary health care spending . Nearly half of these savings were kept by CMS and the American taxpayer , and the majority ( $55 million ) of the remainder went directly to physician practices . \"Six years ago , we made a bold wager - that by empowering small , independent primary care practices you could change the face of health care,\" said Farzad Mostashari , MD , CEO and co-founder of Aledade . \"Those primary care practices are delivering on that promise . Thanks to years of hard work and collective effort , our nationwide network of hundreds of primary care practices has proven , across states and across payers , that you can reduce spending in health care and you can do it the right way: by helping patients stay healthy rather than waiting for them to get sick.\" By emphasizing prevention and expanding access to primary care services , every Aledade Medicare ACO achieved an average quality score of more than 90 percent for the year , with every single practice working with Aledade earning the \"exceptional performance bonus\" in the Merit-based Incentive Payment System . Aledade ACOs in Medicare Advantage have earned an average of 4 STARS , often making significant improvements . In North Carolina , for example , practices improved their Medicare Advantage STARS rating from 3.0 to 4.5 after just one year of working with Aledade . These quality metrics reflect real-world improvements in patient care . For instance , the nearly 5,000 independent physicians practicing in Aledade's Medicare ACOsin 2019 reduced patient stays in hospitals by an average of nine percent , avoiding more than 10,000hospitalizations . Aledade Medicare ACOs increased primary care services by 7.5 percent between 2018 and 2019 , leading to 90,000 more visits between patients and their primary care physician .

The bipartisan letter outlines the impact these cuts will have on the healthcare system and calls for Congress to act to stop them from taking effect on January 1 , 2021 . \"Payment cuts of this magnitude will surely strain a health care system that is already stressed by the COVID-19 pandemic and could jeopardize patient access to medically necessary services,\" write Reps . Bera and Bucshon . \"In order to safeguard beneficiaries' access to care during this pandemic , we as Congress should examine possible bipartisan solutions to address excessively steep cuts . We encourage you to incorporate the resulting policy changes in any upcoming legislation moving through the House.\" Earlier this year , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed a new Medicare Physician Fee Schedule set to take effect in the new year , which will cut Medicare payments for surgical care by up to nine percent for some specialties . This rule would be harmful without COVID-19 but is especially reckless given the pandemic and will force surgeons around the country to make tough decisions . In some cases , surgeons may have to decide between keeping their practice open and cutting costs like new staff , Medicare patient intake , and new surgical technologies . The Surgical Care Coalition ( SCC ) represents more than 150,000 surgeons across the country and is advocating Congress to stop these cuts due to the impact on patients . A recent surveyof more than 1,000 members of the American College of Surgeons found that nearly one third of surgeons surveyed said they will have to reduce their Medicare patient intake because of the cuts . In addition , one in five surgeons say they may need to stop performing certain procedures to reduce costs as a result of these cuts . The SCC has also advocated against the cuts because of the COVID-19 pandemic saying now is not the time to be cutting Medicare payments . A surveyconducted earlier this year found one-in-three private practice surgeons may already have to shut down their practices as a result of the impact of COVID-19 . \"As physicians themselves , Reps .

      "Processing sentence: Democrats Begin Positioning For Election Fraud Asserts Republican Party of St . Lucie County PORT ST . LUCIE , Fla. , Oct . 8 , 2020 / / The following is a statement from Mark Gotz , Chairman of the Republican Party of St Lucie County: Election Supervisor Gertrude Walker has denied the Republican Party the right to observe the ballot signature match , which matches signatures on vote by mail ( VBM ) ballot envelopes with those on record with the Supervisor of Elections . \"During the primary election we watched the process of matching the signature on the VBM envelope against the signature on file with the Supervisor of Elections . I witnessed numerous VBM unsigned envelopes that weren't rejected . They should have been rejected,\" said Mark Gotz , Chairman of the Republican Party of St Lucie County . \"Those VBM ballots were moved into the counting cage over my objections,\" said Gotz . This denial removes the transparency citizens need to know that their votes matter . In the primary election ballot envelopes clearly showed the Voter's Party Affiliation on the mail-in ballot envelopes . This allows third parties who handle the ballots to know the name , precinct and party affiliation of the voter . Democrats and the mainstream media claim there is no evidence of widespread voting fraud . This would be countered by The Heritage Foundation's compilation of adjudicated voter frauds which stands at 1298 cases nationwide with 1121 convictions . Judicial Watch sued California and in specific Los Angeles County over its dirty voter rolls and in June 2019 , LA settled by agreeing to remove 1.5 Million ineligible or dead voter records from its rolls . In this general election , over 50% of the votes are expected to be mail-in ballots . Without the transparency of observation , with enough viewing time to gather the information to challenge ballots during the signature matching process , the integrity of Election results will always be in question . Ballot integrity and transparency cannot be restored if the signature match process goes unobserved . Once the ballots are separated from their envelopes you can never trace the vote or the voter . Recounts then become useless . We hope other states will endeavor to verify their VBM ballots in a similar manner . \"In concert with FL Statutes 101.572 and 101.68c4 , the Republican Party demands transparency in the validation , opening , and counting of vote by mail ballots . The time for action is now!\" continued Mr . Gotz . SOURCE Republican Party of St Lucie Related Links https://stluciegop.org\n",

      "Processing sentence: Sobi announces topline phase 3 data of avatrombopag for the treatment of Chemotherapy-Induced Thrombocytopenia STOCKHOLM , Oct . 9 , 2020 / / Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB ( publ ) ( Sobi ) ( STO:SOBI ) today announced topline results from its phase 3 study of avatrombopag , an oral thrombopoietin ( TPO ) receptor agonist , in solid tumour cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia ( CIT ) . Though avatrombopag increased platelet counts relative to placebo as expected , the study did not meet the composite primary endpoint of avoiding platelet transfusions , chemotherapy dose reductions by 15 per cent or greater , and chemotherapy dose delays by four days or more . In the intent-to-treat population ( full analysis set ) , 69.5 per cent and 72.5 per cent of avatrombopag and placebo subjects , respectively , were considered responders for the primary endpoint ( p=0.72 ) . In the per-protocol population , 85.0 per cent and 84.4 per cent of avatrombopag and placebo subjects , respectively , were considered responders for the primary endpoint ( p=0.96 ) . It was unexpected that the placebo subjects would have such a low incidence of dose delays and dose reductions and additional data analyses are ongoing to understand this observation . Topline adverse event data for avatrombopag reinforce the existing safety profile and were comparable to that of placebo in this population of cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy . \"While we are disappointed that avatrombopag failed to show efficacy in CIT , we are deeply grateful to the patients , investigators , and clinical site staff who contributed to the study's completion . Due to the lack of an approved treatment we firmly believe that avatrombopag could benefit patients with CIT . We were pleased to see that few patients required platelet transfusions or dose modifications in this study and were able to receive their chemotherapy without interruption.\" , said Guido Oelkers , CEO and President of Sobi . \"We will continue to focus on the launches of the CLD and ITP indications and peak sales estimates remain unchanged given the potential of the product.\" About the phase 3 study The phase 3 randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avatrombopag in subjects with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia ( CIT ) receiving chemotherapy to treat ovarian , lung ( small cell and non-small cell ) , and bladder cancer . The composite primary endpoint was the efficacy of avatrombopag in increasing platelet counts and therefore preventing the need for a platelet transfusion or chemotherapy dose reduction or delay in subjects with CIT . The secondary endpoint was safety . A total of 122 patients who developed Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia following a previous cycle of chemotherapy were enrolled in 71 sites around the world . About Chemotherapy-Induced Thrombocytopenia ( CIT ) CIT , a potentially serious complication of chemotherapy , results in low platelet levels and can lead to chemotherapy dose reductions , chemotherapy dose delays , or changes to chemotherapy regimens .

MOLINE,Ill. , Sept . 15,2020 / / John Deere ( NYSE:DE ) , the National Black Growers Council ( NBGC ) , and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund ( TMCF ) announced today they are establishing a coalition focused on the work needed to improve the livelihoods of Black farmers with a particular emphasis on the preservation of heirs' property in rural communities throughout the United States . \"Property ownership is a driver of economic growth for individuals and families . However , too often the benefits of ownership for those who lack clear title cannot be truly realized,\" said Marc Howze , Group President , Lifecycle Solutions and Chief Administrative Officer for John Deere . The new coalition , entitled LEAP ( Legislation , Education , Advocacy , and Production Systems ) , will collectively address priority legislation , expand educational and advocacy opportunities , and ensure access to tools and technology all farmers need to successfully navigate advanced production systems . \"Land is a farmer's most valuable and productive asset , yet 60 percent of Black farmers operate on property that has been passed through their families for generations but for which they do not have secure title .

      "Processing sentence: Epilepsy Foundation Launches New Spanish-Language Content to Provide Hispanics with More Epilepsy-Related Resources New Partnership with National Hispanic Medical Association Helps Expand Reach LANDOVER , Md. , Sept . 15 , 2020 / / The Epilepsy Foundation kicked off National Hispanic Heritage Month today by introducing new Spanish-language content to offer Hispanics easier-to-access medical information and resources about epilepsy and seizures . The new Spanish-language content on the Epilepsy Foundation's website epilepsy.com complements the resources available to everyone impacted by epilepsy , including health education , seizure first aid trainings and toll-free 24/7 Helpline . There are more than 710,000 Hispanics living with epilepsy in the U.S . Yet , despite its prevalence , people do not completely understand epilepsy . This leads to many misperceptions about the disease and contributes to discrimination , difficulty with diagnosis , and even failure to follow a seizure treatment plan . Although , epilepsy can affect everyone , minority communities have less access to specialized epilepsy treatment and care . \"Latinos face linguistic and cultural barriers to understanding complex medical conditions , now add epilepsy and seizures to the mix and it becomes even more challenging,\" said Angel Hernandez , MD , division chief , Neurosciences , Helen DeVos Children's Hospital; and editor for Spanish-language content on epilepsy.com . \"Culturally appropriate education and resources for people with epilepsy and their families is critical for seizure control and improved quality of life.\" The new Spanish-language content provides Hispanics with vital information so that they can learn more about epilepsy , make informed decisions and educate themselves and others on seizure recognition and first aid . In addition to educational content , the Epilepsy Foundation recently rolled out its #StaySafeSide seizure first aid initiative in Spanish #PermanezcaSeguraDeLado . The initiative highlights how easy it is to help someone who is having a seizure and how these simple steps Permanezca Segura De Lado ( Stay Safe Side ) will help us remember basic seizure first aid . \"We are strengthening our commitment to the Spanish-speaking community by offering in-language content to help families better understand epilepsy,\" said Laura Thrall , president and chief executive officer , Epilepsy Foundation . \"There is a clear need for more accurate , high-quality , epilepsy-related information in Spanish . Our dedicated Spanish-language digital platform also gives us the opportunity to expand our partnerships with other organizations focused on this community so that we can extend our reach among Hispanics.\" For years , the Epilepsy Foundation has offered tools and resources in Spanish through its Multicultural Outreach program , which is part of its cooperative agreement with the U.S . Centers for Disease Control & Prevention . In addition , the Epilepsy Foundation has partnered with other organizations to promote seizure first aid and extend its reach through social media and public service announcements .

The percentage of female directors in the Russell 3000 increased by just 4.2 percentage points , and over 13 percent of the companies in the index still had no female directors . Moreover , only about 10 percent of S&P 500 companies explicitly report the ethnicity of their individual directors , and 8 out of 10 of the directors at those companies are white . These findings and insights come from a new report published by The Conference Board and ESG data analytics firm ESGAUGE , in collaboration with Debevoise & Plimpton , the KPMG Board Leadership Center , Russell Reynolds Associates , and the John L . Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance . The report examines corporate board trends across the S&P 500 and the wider Russell 3000 based on a comprehensive review of 2019 corporate disclosure and organizational documents , and covers topics including board composition and diversity , the profile and skill sets of directors , as well as policies on their election , removal , and retirement . \"There are several practical steps companies can take to increase boardroom diversity and strengthen their boards as a strategic asset,\" said Matteo Tonello , Managing Director of the ESG Center and the author of the report . \"They include making diversity a consideration in every board search , enhancing the diversity of nominating committees and in board leadership positions , adopting limits on the number of boards on which directors can serve , and implementing more robust processes for recruiting , onboarding , and engaging first-time directors.\" \"As part of its mission , The Conference Board is proud to make its report and unique database on corporate board practices available to the public , and we are grateful to the extraordinary coalition of leading firms that made this possible,\" added Tonello . \"Reviewing the entire Russell 3000 index is critical to shed light on the progress that can still be made in corporate governance , especially among smaller corporations outside of the S&P 500 . For example , by covering the Russell 3000 we highlight that about 400 public companies do not yet have a single woman on their board , and that more than 40 percent of the Russell 3000 companies continue to organize their board in classes of directors so as to avoid annual elections for all.\" Key findings from the new analysis include: 1 .

Notably , CBD is having a major impact on global markets because it offers a number of therapeutic benefits without the psychoactive effects of THC . There has also been a substantial growth in demand for cannabidiol ( CBD ) products around the globe in recent years , mainly in developed countries such as the U.S. , France , Canada and the Netherlands . Part of the spike in interest can be attributed to the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill , which legalized production of industrial hemp , transforming it into a mainstream agricultural product . Shortly after , numerous categories of CBD products started to appear . Perhaps not surprisingly , hemp and CBD products are potentially stealing market share from other markets , such as tobacco for example . According to data provided by the Brightfield Group and published by Hemp Industry Daily , a survey of more than 5,000 CBD users in the U.S . reveals that 24% have used it to help quit smoking and quitters are often replacing cigarettes with either smokable hemp or vaping . Additionally , 41% of quitters have entirely replaced their tobacco with hemp CBD . Kaival Brands Innovations Group , Inc . ( OTC: KAVL ) , Taat Lifestyle & Wellness Ltd .

Nevertheless , the tobacco industry is a major market , and in some aspects , it is evolving to adapt to a new demographic . Next generation products , such as new forms of e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products , are coming in the market . These products are exhibiting technological innovation and change , which the tobacco industry has not experienced in many decades . Nevertheless , the attempts of governments to reduce tobacco consumption have seen mixed results . According to the WHO's report from last year , for the first time , the organization projects that the number of males using tobacco is on the decline , indicating a powerful shift in the global tobacco epidemic .

Over the years , advances in cell biology and pharmacology have led to the development of a variety of advanced biologics , which experts believe , possess the potential to address several unmet needs associated with the treatment of different types of diseases . Currently , there are more than 1,000 cell and gene therapies under development; most of which are being developed for the treatment of oncological disorders , cardiovascular disorders and neurological disorders . Additionally , over the last decade , multiple immunotherapies have been developed , and have led to a decrease in lung cancer and melanoma-related mortality . Despite their many benefits , biologics present a number of challenges , such as drug delivery related complexities , and immunogenicity concerns , which have been shown to result in systemic toxicity post therapy administration . To avoid such systemic toxic effects , a limited volume of drug is administered , which often results in a small amount of drug reaching the target organ . Further , from a pharmacological point of view , the drug stays at the target site for a limited time , hence decreasing the final therapeutic effect that can be achieved through prolonged and controlled drug delivery . Moreover , some of such treatment options , such as cell therapies , require periodic administration of additional therapy material , or complementary products , thereby , adding to the already complex invasive dosing procedure . In order to address challenges , a number of innovator companies in the biopharmaceutical sector are actively engaged in identifying targeted and effective delivery strategies for biologics , including gene therapies , cell/stem cell therapies , immunotherapies and therapeutic proteins . Examples of devices designed for the targeted delivery of biologics include Advance CS , ExtroducerTM microcatheter , HelixT biotherapeutic delivery system , ImmunoPulse IL-12 , SmartFlow neuro ventricular cannula and MailPan . Some drug delivery devices have been demonstrated to have an improved therapeutic safety index , and are capable of accurately delivering biological interventions to the target physiological site . Further , certain implantable delivery systems have also been developed in order to prolong the therapeutic effect of biologics . Given the rapid pace of growth within the biopharmaceutical market , the demand for effective delivery systems is anticipated to increase in the foreseen future . This may be expected to create lucrative opportunities for stakeholders in the targeted drug delivery systems market.The report features an extensive study of the current market landscape , offering an informed opinion on the likely adoption of such medical devices , over the next decade . The study features an in-depth analysis of the key drivers and trends related to this domain . What type of devices are capable of providing targeted delivery\n"

Studies continue to show that dieting with a partner leads to greater success and helps people maintain their weight loss . According to a recent JAMA study , individuals are more likely to lose five percent or more weight if their partner joins them . A five percent weight loss is considered clinically significant to reaping health benefits like reduced risks of developing diabetes , heart disease , and certain types of cancer . Evidence suggests that people tend to exhibit the health behaviors of those around them and that partners greatly influence that behavior , especially in relation to diet and exercise . For Nutrisystem customers , social support and accountability are two factors proven to facilitate weight loss . Now , the Partner Plan offers Nutrisystem customers a shared experience to leverage those factors . \"Eating is a social event and with the new Nutrisystem Partner Plan , friends and loved ones can enjoy meals together,\" said Tommy Lewis , President , Nutrisystem . \"We are less likely to stay on a weight loss program when we feel like we're all alone . Having a built-in support system at home means you'll be able to motivate and celebrate each other as you hit goals . In today's climate , it is more important than ever for our health to connect with and lean on the strength of loved ones.\" On the Nutrisystem Partner Plan , customers will receive one shipment every two weeks that includes meals and snacks for two people at one great price . The program also provides free access to the NuMiapp , unlimited support with Nutrisystem weight loss counselors and dietitians by phone or online any day of the week , and free shipping . Customers can lose weight while eating the foods they love , made healthier . The program meets , or in most cases exceeds , recommendations set forth in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans . The plans include the right mix of nutrients to fuel your body - plenty of healthy , lean protein; high fiber to help keep you feeling fuller , longer; low-glycemic carbohydrates to stabilize blood sugar; and never contain artificial sweeteners or flavors . Those with specific dietary needs can customize their program to include diabetes-friendly foods , vegetarian foods , or to exclude foods that contain milk , wheat , nuts , and more .

      "Processing sentence: Ascentage Pharma's Bcl-2 Inhibitor APG-2575 Granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the Treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia SUZHOU , China and ROCKVILLE , Md. , Sept . 7 , 2020 / / Ascentage Pharma ( 6855.HK ) , a globally focused , clinical-stage biotechnology company engaged in developing novel therapies for cancers , chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) , and age-related diseases , today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has granted APG-2575 , a novel Bcl-2 inhibitor being developed by the company , an Orphan Drug Designation ( ODD ) for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . This is the second ODD granted for APG-2575 , following the previous ODD granted by the FDA in July for the treatment of Waldenstr m Macroglobulinemia ( WM ) . The term \"orphan drugs\" refers to pharmaceutical products developed for the prevention , diagnosis , and treatment of rare diseases or conditions . In the United States , an orphan disease is defined as a disease or condition with a prevalence of less than 200,000 patients in the country . Since the Orphan Drug Act was passed in 1983 , the US government has provided incentives and policy support to encourage development of orphan drugs . This ODD from the FDA qualifies APG-2575 for various development incentives , including a tax credit on expenditures incurred in clinical studies , a waiver of the New Drug Application ( NDA ) fee , research grant awarded by the FDA , and most importantly , 7 years of US market exclusivity upon approval for the treatment of CLL . CLL is a form of leukemia among adults , characterized by progressive accumulation of abnormal lymphocytes cells in the peripheral blood , bone marrow and lymphoid tissues . The American Cancer Society estimates the U.S will have approximately 21,040 new cases of CLL and about 4,060 deaths from the disease in 2020[1] . The most recent SEERs update reiterates that the prevalence of CLL remains below 200,000 in the USA[2] . Development of Bruton tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) inhibitors and Bcl-2 inhibitors have improved the outcomes of patients with CLL; however , there is still the medical needs for therapies with improved safety profile and shortened ramp-up schedule that achieve deep responses with shorter duration of treatments especially for chemotherapy free regimens in CLL . APG-2575 is a novel , orally administered Bcl-2 selective inhibitor being developed by Ascentage Pharma . APG-2575 is designed to treat a variety of hematologic malignancies by selectively blocking Bcl-2 to restore the normal apoptosis process in cancer cells . APG-2575 is one of the few Bcl-2 selective inhibitors currently in active clinical development worldwide and the first China-developed Bcl-2 selective inhibitor having entered clinical trials in China . APG-2575 has received clearances and approvals for multiple Phase Ib/II clinical studies in China , Australia , and the US in a range of hematologic malignancies , including a global Phase Ib/II clinical study of APG-2575 as a single agent or\n"

      "Processing sentence: Willow Biosciences announces successful production of pure cannabigerol VANCOUVER , BC , Sept 21 , 2020 / / -Willow Biosciences Inc. ( \"Willow\" or the \"Company\" ) ( TSX:WLLW ) ( OTCQX:CANSF ) is pleased to announce that it has successfully developed a scalable process for producing cannabigerol ( \"CBG\" ) with greater than 99% purity and no detectable THC and demonstrated production at 500 litre scale . The Company previously announced that , in collaboration with its development partner , Albany Molecular Research , Inc. , it had commenced a 500 litre pilot scale campaign . The Company now reports that the pilot campaign was a success and in addition to optimizing the production process using its proprietary yeast strain , the Company has developed a high-yielding downstream purification process that provides CBG with greater than 99% purity . This highly productive strain and simplified downstream process should enable manufacturing in smaller , capital-light , GMP-compliant fermentation production facilities , at a fraction of the cost and environmental footprint of plant cultivation and extraction . \"Achieving scalable production of pure CBG is a pivotal milestone for both Willow and our industry\" said Trevor Peters , Willow's Chief Executive Officer . \"The market opportunity for high-purity cannabinoids manufactured under GMP control is expected to be in the billions of dollars in the coming years , and as the first company to successfully produce product samples , Willow is poised to capture a sizable portion of that market . We anticipate being able to begin commercialization of CBG in the first half of 2021 and are currently selecting manufacturing partners to assist us in reaching both local and worldwide markets.\" Willow expects to deliver samples of its produced CBG to prospective partners in the coming weeks and has seen initial demand for samples from Canada , United States , Brazil , Europe , Australia and South East Asia . Demand is evident from all segments of the consumers packaged goods industry including nutraceuticals , food and beverage , personal care and over-the-counter medicine . Providing Willow's prospective partners with high purity samples from its pilot production run is the most significant hurdle before entering into commercial agreements . CBG is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid with early research suggesting it has a range of bioactive properties in the body that include anti-microbial and antioxidant functions . From early discussions with key stakeholders in the nutraceutical , personal care , food and beverage industries , the Company believes that CBG has the potential to be as impactful to the recreational , health and wellness landscape as cannabidiol ( \"CBD\" ) has become , and this will pave the way for other cannabinoids to enter the marketplace based upon the distinct differences in how they function in the body as well as their applicability to product formulation .

( OTC: LBYYQ ) ( \"Libbey\" or the \"Company\" ) , one of the world's largest glass tableware manufacturers , filed an Amended Plan of Reorganization ( the \"Plan\" ) and a related Disclosure Statement today in the U.S . Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware ( \"the Court\" ) . The Plan outlines the Company's proposal to strengthen its balance sheet , reduce debt and improve liquidity in order to emerge from bankruptcy as a financially stronger company . As contemplated under the terms of the Plan , Libbey has received a term sheet from seven of its lenders to provide $150 million in exit financing , which net of lender fees and repayment of the Company's existing debtor-in-possession ( \"DIP\" ) financing will provide $75 million of incremental funding for the Company's exit from bankruptcy and go-forward operations . Libbey also expects to replace its $100 million DIP revolving credit facility with a new exit facility with approximately $20 million initially drawn . Overall , Libbey expects to emerge from the Chapter 11 process with less than $200 million of funded debt , compared to more than $400 million of debt that existed at the beginning of the court-supervised process . Additionally , as required under the terms of the Plan , Libbey today filed motions with the Court to modify its collective bargaining agreements ( \"CBAs\" ) and certain union-related retiree benefits . If approved by the Court , the motions will modify the CBAs for Libbey employees represented by the United Steelworkers and the International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers . Under the terms of the Company's proposals to the unions , Libbey is seeking to modify wages , certain benefits ( including freezing future benefit accruals under its hourly defined benefit pension plan ) and certain work rules for its U.S . union employees . In addition to these proposed modifications , the Company has also taken actions to reduce its salaried headcount and the wage and benefit costs relating to its salaried employees , as well as non-salary related costs . All of these actions , including the proposed modifications to the Company's CBAs and certain union-related retiree benefit obligations , provide cost reductions that are essential to the Company's successful reorganization . As part of optimizing its manufacturing capacity , Libbey has committed to its previously announced plan to close its manufacturing facility in Shreveport , Louisiana . The Company intends to cease production by the end of 2020 , with full closure to be completed by the second half of 2022 . Libbey continues to negotiate with the United Steelworkers representing the Company's employees regarding the effects of the facility closure . Mike Bauer , chief executive officer of Libbey\n",

The campaign centers on the actions of executives from Denver area HealthONE hospitals , which is owned by Nashville-based for-profit HCA Healthcare . It comes on the heels of recent reports by the Denver Postthat low staffing levels at HealthONE hospitals in metro Denver contributed to a patient's death and preventable harm to others . Efforts to raise public awareness in the Denver market about these issues will include a website ( http://www.HealthONEFailures.com ) , TV advertisementson CNN , ESPN , MSNBC and other top-rated channels , social media advertisements , and more . The public information campaign is being funded by the nation's largest organization of professional healthcare workers , known as SEIU . Those workers are decrying patterns within the HealthONE system of hospital executives purveying high prices , low staffing , and aggressive collection practices toward HealthONE/HCA patients . The Denver market is a cash cow for HealthONE and HCA , who reported hundreds of millions in profits at their Denver area hospital in 2018 according to the most recently available Medicare Cost Report data . Meanwhile , HCA and HealthONE also contributed significant amounts to lobbying efforts against affordable healthcare for Colorado residents . \"We feel morally obligated to make people aware about HCA Healthcare HealthONE executives continuing these bad practices amidst the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said Ron Ruggiero , President of the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) Local 105 , which represents healthcare industry workers in Colorado . \"Especially given the large profits this company makes in the Denver area market , Colorado patients and healthcare workers should be prioritized by HealthONE and HCA and right now , that's not happening .

      "Processing sentence: Nemours Actively Supports Federal Legislation to Reduce Medicaid Barriers to Telehealth for Children WASHINGTON , Oct . 2 , 2020 / / Nemours Children's Health System applauds Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester ( D-Del. ) and Congressman Michael C . Burgess ( R-Texas ) for their leadership in introducing the Telehealth Improvement for Kids' Essential Services ( TIKES ) Act of 2020 . Nemours has been a vocal advocate for policies , like the TIKES Act , that remove barriers to covering care provided via telehealth for families receiving Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ) benefits . During the COVID-19 public health emergency , telehealth became crucial for countless families abiding by public health recommendations to temporarily avoid in-person medical visits . Government policy waivers were highly effective in unleashing the power and potential of telehealth to provide safe care to children and families . At Nemours , in the early days of the pandemic response , telehealth visits increased 2,400% and expanded coverage allowed the health system to be reimbursed fairly for the services provided . \"Telehealth has facilitated the delivery of high-quality , efficient care to millions of American children . The public health challenge of COVID-19 highlighted its effectiveness and proved that it will be valuable as a permanent part of the U.S . healthcare system,\" said R . Lawrence Moss , MD , FACS , FAAP , president and CEO of Nemours Children's Health System . \"I commend the leadership of Congresswoman Blunt Rochester and Congressman Burgess in responding to issues raised by health systems like Nemours by introducing this important legislation.\" \"The COVID-19 pandemic has allowed for us to make rapid progress on expanding access to telehealth so children and families across the country , especially those in rural and underserved communities , face fewer barriers to accessing medical care,\" said Rep . Blunt Rochester.\"With the introduction of the TIKES Act , we can continue that progress by bringing better alignment and clarity to Medicaid telehealth policies , as well as provide guidance to state Medicaid programs on the opportunities telehealth services can have for children . I'd like to thank my colleague , Congressman Burgess , for joining me in this critical effort.\" \"Amidst the pain and suffering that our nation has endured throughout the COVID-19 pandemic , a major takeaway has been the advantage of telehealth . There is a convenience factor to not having to take time to physically transport yourself to the doctor's office and have your child sit in a waiting room with other potentially sick patients,\" said Rep . Burgess . \"This bipartisan legislation will improve utilization of telehealth by requiring the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) to provide guidance to states on how to make the most of telehealth options in their Medicaid and CHIP programs . Additionally , it directs studies to gather data that can help inform future telehealth policy . I urge my fellow members to support this legislation that will help build upon the telehealth foundation that we have built\n"

      "Processing sentence: Newlight Technologies' AirCarbon Material has been certified carbon negative by the Carbon Trust HUNTINGTON BEACH , Calif. , Sept . 25 , 2020 / / Newlight Technologies , Inc. , a biotechnology company based in Southern California dedicated to making materials that improve the environment , has worked with the Carbon Trust , an independent organization with a mission to accelerate the move to a sustainable , low carbon economy , to calculate and certify the cradle-to-gate carbon footprint of Newlight's AirCarbon product . The footprint analysis reveals that AirCarbon has a carbon negative cradle-to-gate product carbon footprint . Every day , natural microorganisms in the ocean consume air and greenhouse gas dissolved in saltwater to produce a meltable energy storage material inside of their cells called PHB . Over 10 years of research , Newlight learned how to replicate this process on land by combining natural microorganisms from the ocean with renewable power , air , saltwater , and captured greenhouse gas emissions that would have otherwise been released into the atmosphere to produce PHBa material that Newlight calls AirCarbon . Newlight reached out to the Carbon Trust to calculate and certify the cradle-to-gate product carbon footprint of AirCarbon . As a result , the Carbon Trust found that for every one kilogram of AirCarbon produced in Newlight's production process using methane seeping from abandoned coal mines , 88 kilograms of CO2e are sequestered . \"We are pleased to have worked with Newlight to determine the cradle-to-gate carbon footprint of AirCarbon,\" said Hugh Jones , Managing Director Business Services at the Carbon Trust . \"By consuming greenhouse gas as a resource , and doing it with renewable power , we found that AirCarbon has a net carbon-negative cradle-to-gate carbon footprint.\" \"Independently audited information allows consumers to make informed decisions,\" said Newlight CEO Mark Herrema . \"The Carbon Trust , one of the most well-respected firms in the carbon accounting field , has certified the cradle-to-gate carbon footprint of AirCarbon and found it to be carbon negative . This gives consumers the information they need to decide what kind of impact they want to make . We are grateful for the world-class work that the Carbon Trust carried out in their lifecycle analysis report.\" Newlight's mission is to use AirCarbon to help end climate change and plastics pollution and start to restore the world's ecosystems through the use of carbon-negative materials inspired by regenerative , carbon-negative processes found in nature . The Carbon Trust's certification of AirCarbon's carbon footprint helps enable Newlight to move closer to achieving that mission . About the Carbon Trust The Carbon Trust mission is to accelerate the delivery of a sustainable , low carbon economy by helping businesses , governments and organizations across the globe to reduce carbon emissions and achieve greater resource efficiency . It advises businesses on their opportunities in a sustainable , low carbon world and measures and certifies the environmental footprint of organizations , supply chains and products .

While this stability in retirement confidence seems to be good news , it should also be underscored that only 29 percent are \"very confident\" in their ability to do so . Retirees and Retirement Amid COVID-19 is based on findings from TCRS' 20th Annual Retirement Survey , which comprises a supplemental survey conducted in June 2020 and a broader survey in late 2019 . The research examines retirees' finances before and during the pandemic , and their preparations during their working years . How Retirees Are Faring Amid the Pandemic \"Retirees , in some ways , may be more resilient in this economic downturn than employed workers . Most have guaranteed income in the form of Social Security and access to health insurance coverage through Medicare . Unlike employed workers , most retirees do not have a job to lose,\" said Catherine Collinson , CEO and president of Transamerica Institute and TCRS . \"Nevertheless , they are still susceptible to both the health and economic effects of the pandemic.\" The June 2020 survey yields these insights: Nine in 10 retirees are generally happy and have close relationships with families and/or friends ( both 91 percent ) . Eighty-four percent are enjoying life . However , some are struggling , including those who feel isolated and lonely ( 20 percent ) , have trouble making ends meet ( 21 percent ) , or often feel anxious and depressed ( 24 percent ) . Retirees are taking care of their health but can do more . Fifty-three percent eat healthily , 52 percent exercise regularly , and 62 percent get plenty of rest . Fewer than seven in 10 indicate they seek medical attention when needed ( 69 percent ) . Fewer than six in 10 retirees would rely on savings if their finances are negatively impacted by the pandemic ( 56 percent ) . Other often mentioned sources include: credit cards ( 18 percent ) , withdrawals from retirement accounts ( 18 percent ) , and CARES Act stimulus money ( 18 percent ) . Many retirees cite paying off some form of debt as a financial priority ( 45 percent ) . One in three cite building emergency savings as a priority and 23 percent are just getting by to cover basic living expenses .

I've just been focusing on what I want to do without restrictions on the technical or academic field . For example , chemistry and physics as two separate disciplines have little meaning in materials science . My main interest is in functional materials utilizing electrons in solids . In the case of semiconductors , I study the movement of electrons under an electric field , and superconductors are similar you manipulate electrons in catalysis to react with molecules on a surface . \"My PhD thesis was on line shape analysis of electron spin resonance spectra in glass rather fundamental work . After that , I did joint work in the material sciences department at Nagoya Institute of Technology , where I worked with ceramics , especially photoactive glasses and protonic conduction in glass . I did ion implantation into SiO2 glass for a year at Vanderbilt University in the U.S . as well as research at Oak Ridge National Lab , in Tennessee . \"I returned to Japan , to Tokyo Tech , and changed my research topic from photoactive glasses to oxide semiconductors . The most visible result of my work at that time was the proposal of transparent amorphous oxide semiconductors for thin film transistors , leading to the IGZO TFT , which is now used in high-resolution LCD panels such as tablets and OLEDs for TV screens . When I started this research in 1993 , there was almost no work being done in the field . But now , 25 years later , oxide semiconductors are the world standard for TFTs for flat-panel displays and beyond . It was during this work on oxide semiconductors that we discovered iron-based superconductors.\" SOURCE International Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics ( WPI-MANA ) , National Institute for Materials Science ( NIMS )\n",

The foundation partnership is the result of a shared vision to make global access to swift , safe low-cost Open Finance solutions a reality .

CorionX is hosting the third and final round of its CORX DeFi token IEO which started on Probit exchange on Monday the 5th of October , 5:00 am ( GMT+2 ) . The ETH Conundrum Scalability and cost are two of the biggest factors that determine whether or not a new digital currency will have a chance to be adopted on a global scale . Ethereum is currently the blockchain of finance , but increasing stablecoin and DeFi transactions have exacerbated an already congested network , only equipped to process around 15 transactions per second.Such congestion has resulted in record ETH transaction fees ( $15 this September ) for ERC-20 token users , and by even the most optimistic claims , the phase zero groundwork of the solution promised by the ETH 2.0 Launch will not come into effect until November2020 . With stablecoins unable to go mainstream due to Ethereum network limitations , and big questions still hanging over token scalability , it seems that interoperability is the next logical step.The Stable SolutionThe Syscoin and Corion foundations are currently working together to provision Syscoin Bridge , a decentralized cross-chain interoperability solution that works today , to support CorionX ( CORX ) , Corion's ERC-20 token and other Ethereum-based Stablecoins and DeFi tokens . The Layer 2 and Cross-Chain bridge solution provides scalability and microtransactions , solving the micropayments issue and scaling-up stablecoin transactions.This Solution will provide cheaper and faster transactions enabled by Syscoin's unique Z-DAG Protocol , and more robust security offered by Syscoin's blockchain which is bitcoin-core-compliant and merge-mined.Jag Sidhu , Syscoin Foundation Chairmanstated:\"Our combined focus will include specific stablecoins , DeFi , and helping the unbanked and over-banked .

Marco supports SMEs based in Latin America , where a $350 billion trade finance gap blocks many exporters from the U.S . market . The funding includes an equity round , led by Struck Capitaland Antler , and a credit facility underwritten by Arcadia Funds , LLC . \"As a former owner of a small business in Latin America , I saw firsthand how SMEs in this region struggle to access trade financing that will let them export their goods while retaining enough capital to keep their business running,\" said Peter D . Spradling , COO and co-founder of Marco . \"Access to trade finance is one of the greatest hurdles in business operations . The traditional system , dominated by banks , simply is not working anymore . It disproportionately hurts SMEs , restricts economic mobility and stifles job creation in emerging markets . With equity funding and a material credit facility we can serve this disadvantaged market in Latin America and help build a healthier , more equitable trade ecosystem reflective of an increasingly borderless global economy.\" SMEs are growth-drivers of international trade , accounting for 60% of total employment in advanced economies and 80% in developing countries , including those in Latin America . Yet these exporters face massive financial hurdles due to long payment cycles . The gap between when goods are shipped by the exporter and when the buyer submits payment can last 2-4 months , an impossibly long wait for SME exporters who often lack the capital to maintain operations while waiting for payment . Banks , traditionally the primary providers of trade finance to address these challenges , reject 50% of SME financing applicants and largely retreated from SME trade lending in the tighter regulatory climate following the 2008 financial crisis . The impacts of this trend have been greatly amplified by the conservative liquidity approaches banks have adopted in response to the Covid-19 pandemic . Marco addresses this financing gap by providing fast and easy financing to Latin American SME exporters selling to U.S . buyers with an innovative due diligence process that leverages real-time data to dynamically assess risk and mitigate capital loss .

      "Processing sentence: UK Supreme Court Affirms the Right of Conversant Wireless to Seek a Worldwide Portfolio FRAND License in its Case Against Huawei and ZTE OTTAWA , ON , Aug . 26 , 2020 / / - Conversant Wireless Licensing S . r.l. , a subsidiary of Conversant Intellectual Property Management Inc. , announced today it has won a landmark judgment of the United Kingdom Supreme Court that will have significant implications worldwide for standard-essential-patent ( SEP ) licensing , especially in the area of telecommunications . The unanimous judgment affirmed both the Court of Appeal and the Patents Court in permitting Conversant Wireless to seek a \"FRAND injunction\" in its patent-infringement case against Huawei and ZTE . Under a FRAND injunction , Huawei and ZTE , having been found to infringe a valid SEP of Conversant Wireless , will need to enter into a worldwide portfolio license with Conversant on terms that the UK Patents Court will determine to be fair , reasonable , and non-discriminatory ( FRAND ) ; should either company fail to do so , then it will risk being subject to an injunction restraining its further infringing activities in the UK . The practical effect of today's ruling is that implementers cannot insist that SEP holders like Conversant Wireless prove their patents in every jurisdiction in the world , something that would be both practically and economically prohibitive , especially for smaller companies such as Conversant . Otherwise , as the Supreme Court observed , \"implementers who were infringing the patents would have an incentive to continue infringing\" . \"We are very pleased with the judgment today,\" said Boris Teksler , Conversant's CEO . \"The UK Supreme Court decision confirms the entire well-reasoned , deeply analyzed jurisprudence that has emerged in the UK courts . It confirms Conversant Wireless' approach , that as a holder of cellular standard-essential patents , we can seek proper value for our patents without having to resort to what the UK courts themselves called the 'madness' of country-by-country licensing and related litigation . This helps level the playing field when small companies are trying to license SEP portfolios to global giants with seemingly limitless litigation resources.\" In an earlier trial in the case , the UK Patents Court found that claims of two Conversant Wireless LTE SEPs granted by the European Patent Office are essential to the LTE standard . As such , the patents are infringed in the UK by the sales of LTE handsets of Huawei and ZTE . The court also found that the infringed claims are valid . ( These finding are on appeal and set to be heard in November. ) As a consequence of that determination on the two LTE patents , Conversant Wireless now is asking the court to declare that Conversant has made a FRAND offer to license its SEP portfolio to each defendant , and to determine the FRAND terms for such a license to each defendant . The FRAND trial is set to begin at the end of January 2021 . The appeal in\n",

The new Lincoln Institute guidebook How to Use Exploratory Scenario Planning ( XSP ) : Navigating an Uncertain Future , by Jeremy Stapleton , provides a roadmap for making decisions or plans in the face of critical unknowns and unclear futures . Jeremy Stapleton facilitates exploratory scenario planning with a team from the City of Avondale , Arizona , at the Arizona Growing Water Smart Workshop in Phoenix , February 2020 . Credit: Diego Lomelli Trejo . A process for exploring the driving forces and implications of different futures , XSP guides participants in assessing how best to prepare for any and all of them . Rather than working toward a single vision , practitioners develop distinct potential futures ( \"scenarios\" ) and consider how to measure and prepare for each . Through this process , communities can identify the actors , strategies , contingency plans , and partnerships that will help them achieve their goals under varying future conditionsand adapt to changing factors in real time . For example , the City and County of Denver used XSP in the 2017 Denveright project , an update of the successful 2002 integrated transportation and land use plan , to identify common themes like the regional desire for equity and access . The process also helped dissolve departmental silos , resulting in a plan adopted in April 2019 . The University of Arizona Water Resources Research Center also employed XSP to inform the development of a management plan for the Upper Gila Watershed in 2014 . The project effectively conveyed the wide-ranging possibilities for water supply and demand , development patterns , and other driving forces in the coming decades , and it engaged with a broad cross-section of water users , resulting in ongoing and productive dialogues . \"Exploratory Scenario Planning shows how cities and regions don't have to simply react to major events and emerging forces like the pandemic , but we can envision and prepare for unexpected consequences in advance,\" said Ted Knowlton , deputy director of the Wasatch Front Regional Council , which oversees regional planning in the Salt Lake City area.Because it encompasses possibilities rather than assumptions , XSP enables more robust plans than those produced with traditional methods .

      "Processing sentence: Hypolipidemics Global Market Report 2020-30: Covid 19 Impact and Recovery NEW YORK , Sept . 15 , 2020 / / Major players in the hypolipidemic drugs market are ABBOTT LABORATORIES LIMITED , Apotex Fermentation Inc. , BIOCON LIMITED IN Bangalore , Cadila Healthcare Limited and Chunghwa Chem Syn& Biotech Co. , Ltd.Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05967839/?utm_source=PRN The global hypolipidemics market is expected to decline from $17.6 billion in 2019 to $15.8 billion in 2020 at a compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of -10.3% . The decline is mainly because of the lockdown measures due to the COVID-19 outbreak . The decrease in the number of cardiac surgeries due to re-scheduling of surgeries , cancellations and no-show by patients , decrease in consultations due to restrictions by government and health authorities to provide only emergency services , and less heart disease admissions contribute to this decline . However , the decline is not significant as research showed that the covid patients developed cardiovascular complications , and therefore health authorities advised covid and non-covid cardiac patients to continue the use of CVD drugs . The market is then expected to recover and grow at a CAGR of 3.2% from 2021 and reach $18.3 billion in 2023.The hypolipidemic drugs market consists of sales of hypolipidemic drugs and related services . This industry includes establishments that produce hypolipidemic drugs or agents that lower lipid and lipoproteins levels in the blood . These drugs can be used to prevent cardiovascular diseases and atherosclerosis in Hyperlipidemia patients . Some of the major hypolipidemic drugs include fibric acid derivatives , bile acid binding resins , nicotinamides , and cholesterol absorption inhibitors . The EU agencies take 6 to 12 months to approve the hypolipidemic drugs . Moreover it requires all parts of the registration dossier to be submitted together unlike the US-FDA which accepts phased submissions . The US-FDA assess each technical section in 6 months which may increase to another 6 months if questions/concerns are raised . However , the technical sections' assessment is done simultaneously and therefore the manufacturers should identify the time taking steps and plan the work accordingly and chalk out an estimated date of approval . Also , the license validity and renewal of the application in EU region takes a toll on the manufacturer and adds to the existing regulatory burden . Therefore , the manufacturers hypolipedimic drugs should plan well , communicate effectively in order to minimize the costs and reduce timelines.The growth in the usage of biologics acts as a prime restraint that hinders the hypolipidemic drug market growth . Biologics are derived from living organisms like human beings , animals and microorganisms , different from chemical drugs or chemically synthesized drugs . The increasing preference towards hypolipidemic biologic medicines due to side effects concerns of using chemical synthesized drugs leads to decrease in the sales of traditional hypolipidemic chemical drugs and hence , hindering the hypolipidemic drug ( chemical ) market growth . According to Harvard Medical School , 10%-29% people who consume hypolipidemic drugs such as cholesterol-lowering\n",

      "Processing sentence: The lighting as a service market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 50.4% during the forecast period of 2020-2025 NEW YORK , Sept . 7 , 2020 / / The lighting as a service market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 50.4% during the forecast period of 2020-2025 . The primary driver for the market includes the increasing demand for efficient lighting systems . The growing convergence of the Internet of Things ( IoT ) in the lighting system has a lower consumption of energy across various parts of the world . However , the service's subscription program typically imposes a higher overall cost than the owner pays for the self-installation system , which can likely pose a challenge.Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05962035/?utm_source=PRN - Lighting-as-a-Service ( LaaS ) , also known as Light-as-a-Service , is a service-based business model in which light service is charged on a subscription basis rather than via a one-time payment . It is managed by third parties more precisely by specialized service providers and may include light design , financing , installation , maintenance , and other services . The LaaS model has become more common in commercial and citywide installations of LED lights , specifically in retrofitting buildings and outdoor facilities , with the prior aim of reducing installation costs . Light vendors have used the LaaS strategy in selling value-added services , such as Internet-connected lighting and energy management.- For instance , global LED use has increased substantially in recent years , rising from a market share of 5% in 2013 to nearly half of global lighting sales in 2019 , with integrated LED luminaires making up an increasing share . Several developed markets , including the United States and Europe , are responsible for the rapid expansion of the luminaire market segment . At the same time , China has built a substantive domestic and global manufacturing base.- Moreover , lighting accounts for nearly 10% of electricity usage in households and 18-40% of commercial premises . There is a growing need for energy saving across the globe , creating scope for the market . It is expected that the transition to energy-efficient lighting would reduce the global electricity demand for lighting by 30-40% in 2030 . Using 50+% less energy consumption , LED lights to produce brighter , clearer light without the flicker that often irritates the optic nerve leading to employee complaints about headaches and fatigue . Additionally , LED lights contain NO hazardous materials , don't flicker or strobe , and are completely recyclable.- Countries across the world are widely adopting LED lighting . For instance , New York planned to replace 250,000 streetlights with LEDs , which was to be followed by the replacement of decorative lights in the urban areas . Barcelona ( Spain ) deployed more than 3,000 smart streetlights based on LED technology , gathering information about pollution , humidity , noise , and the overall environment . Moreover , the US Department of Energy ( DOE ) anticipates that , by\n",

PPTA , together with its member companies and patient stakeholder groups around the world , use IPAW to: Raise awareness of source plasma collection Recognize the contributions of plasma donors in saving and improving lives Increase understanding about lifesaving plasma protein therapies and rare diseases . ( PRNewsfoto/Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association ( PPTA ) ) IPAW 2020 is especially significant given the urgent need for plasma donations , which have declined significantly due to the impacts of social distancing measures and other mobility restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic . Considering the complex manufacturing of plasma-derived therapies can take 7-12 months , any decline in plasma donations could impact patients' ability to access their lifesaving therapies . Plasmathe straw-colored , liquid portion of bloodcontains proteins necessary for carrying out critical functions in the human body , such as antibodies to fight diseases and clotting factors to regulate bleeding . If a person has insufficient levels of any one plasma protein , his/her body cannot carry out these vital functions , causing a variety of chronic and life-threatening medical conditions . \"During the current COVID-19 pandemic , the world has come to understand the importance of plasma as a life-saving material,\" said Amy Efantis , PPTA President and CEO . \"What patients around the world have long known , however , is that plasma and plasma donors save lives . Plasma donations in the U.S . and in the EU have decreased over the past few months , but as we observe IPAW this week , we call on donors new and existing to roll up their sleeves and contribute to saving and improving lives . Likewise , we call on regulators here in the United States and in Europe to remove barriers that limit opportunities for committed and healthy adults to donate their plasma . Plasma donors' dedication is more important and essential now than ever before.\"Plasma donations have always been essential and necessary . The COVID-19 pandemic has presented challenges unlike any other the world has experienced in more than 100 years , but PPTA remains steadfastly committed to its mission to promote the availability of and access to safe and effective plasma protein therapies for all patients , no matter where they are around the world .

Mohamed Althaf , the Director of Lulu Group International , awarded the accolade of the 7th CSR Award in 2020 by the Social Responsibility Committee for the CSR Awards . In the previous year , Dr . Althaf was also a recipient of the Sustainability Award 2019 . The retail business director's benchmark role in incorporating sustainable business practices is a spectacle . Continue Reading Dr . Mohamed Althaf Sustainability is already emerging as an important concern for consumers to which companies must respond , as we have recently seen at events such as the World Retail Congress . Increasing sustainability is one of the biggest challenges for retail companies in the decade . Consumers are paying greater attention to the origin of products , and coincidentally , \"zero waste\" movements are gaining importance . 87% of consumersstatethat they would buy products from companies that advocate for social and environmental responsibility , while 76% say they would boycott companies that behave contrary to this . For retailers , aligning with the \"green\" trend isn't just smart from a sustainability standpoint . It also makes sense from a business perspective , saving retailers money and making stores more attractive to increasingly environmentally conscious customers . \"Sustainability has long been a cornerstone of the business model of retail companies . Greater efficiency in the use of resources , energy savings , protection of the environment or the fight against waste , to name a few areas of work , are essential to respond to the growing demands of consumers and guarantee the viability of the business in the medium term,\" adds Dr . Althaf.Sustainability in retail begins at the point of production . For example , in the production process , reduced water and energy consumption at all stages is generally adopted . Retailers also try to make production close to the point of sale as possible and optimize freight transport.The Lulu Group Internationalgoverns its position as one of the biggest retailers , having export and distribution operations in the USA , UK , and European markets . Dr . Althaf also oversees export operations in these markets , citing the priority of sustainability at the helm of each business decision . The Indian business director is an ardent proponent of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals . He seeks to drive at the behest of the retail industry's prospect of sustainability , circularity , health and wellness , and innovation in food technology.The coveted feat awarded to Dr . Althaf commemorates his instrumental role in developing sustainable goals , which are a key to Lulu Group's leading position in the retail sector.Media Contact: Dr.Mohamed Althaf Phone: +97455887280 Email:[emailprotected]Related Imagesdr-mohamed-althaf.jpg Dr .

To stay open , following protocols to keep facilities sanitized is necessary . Elevations RTC understands that families trust the program to provide students with the utmost care the entire time . The focus has always been on helping adolescents get back on track , but the pandemic has created brand new challenges . Open and ready for business , Elevations RTC believes that they have a proper plan to keep everyone in the center as safe and healthy as possible . Trained staff Elevations RTC has always offered every student access to a superb medical staff , 24 hours a day . Led by medical director Dr . Michael Connolly , every medical professional working with the students takes the proper precautions to keep students as healthy as possible . Whether it is cleaning and sterilizing every room before a new student comes in or wearing masks while having face-to-face discussions , the staff is going above and beyond any protocols set by the state of Utah . Another change that Elevations RTC has considered is the impact on students mentally . It is important to monitor mental health with so much added stress during a pandemic . Specific training to handle these types of situations is what Elevations RTC has focused on . Every medical professional has worked on training to be prepared for new problems and warning signs that might pop up during this time . Every staff member is working together to help make this the safest residential treatment center around . Those around the students , the most must set the tone for a cleaner , healthier facility . Prepping students The trained staff will be in charge of ensuring that students feel prepared and ready for the new changes . It can be a challenge for students to learn how to change some habits , but ingraining everything , in the beginning , is one way to go . Students will be closely examined in case anyone starts to show symptoms related to COVID-19 . Staff and students are monitored daily , with daily temperatures as well as checking for symptoms . If a student shows potential signs , they will be sent for testing . There is also the opportunity to socially distance and quarantine if needed . Once on campus , it is about developing habits that will stick with students and become second nature . The protocols are likely going to last at least for the next few months , so developing good habits early on will make it a breeze during the second half of a stay . Smaller groups Building a strong community from within is still an essential part of the process for Elevations RTC . With that said , some adjustments are needed during this time to protect\n",

The segments , which are now available in many leading demand-side platforms , will put the control back in the advertiser's hands to be able to run their ad campaigns along content that is brand safe for them without sacrificing scale . Most brand safety offerings currently available take a binary , keyword-based approach to determining whether a piece of content is brand safe . These basic tools lack the sophistication needed to effectively navigate today's media and content landscape , such as differentiating between actual acts of hate speech and informative content on occurrences of hate speech . In contrast , Comscore utilizes a proprietary pattern-profiling technology that understands the true essence of an article . These unique features give brands far more nuance than what keyword-based solutions can deliver , resulting in safer and more effective advertising . With Comscore's solution , brands will be able to do better than basic keyword blocking and will be able to make the decisions that best fit their brand without having to wipe out large swaths of inventory , like avoiding all news content . \"Words are powerful , but keyword blocking is an outdated , inaccurate , and insufficient approach to managing brand safety,\" said Rachel Gantz , General Manager , Activation Services , Comscore . \"Brands must do the work of determining where they draw the line , and they need the proper tools to enable them to do that .

      "Processing sentence: Port Aransas Ends Harbor Island Litigation PORT ARANSAS , Texas , Sept . 3 , 2020 / / The City of Port Aransas and the Port of Corpus Christi Authority ( PCCA ) have reached an agreement that resolves all litigation between them . PCCA proposes to build a desalination plant and a crude-oil export terminal on Harbor Island just across a narrow shipping channel from Port Aransas' downtown park capable of serving very large crude carriers ( VLCCs ) , each of which is the length of three football fields . The city and a local environmental group , the Port Aransas Conservancy , have opposed these plans as representing an environmental danger to the local estuary and an economic danger to the town's tourism-based economy . Now the city has withdrawn its opposition . In exchange for that PCCA has agreed not to terminate the city's lease on its municipal marina; to permit the city to inspect structures built on Harbor Island within city limits; a promise to move the intake to the desalination plant offshore; and money to help train its volunteer fire department to \"fight fires and other environmental catastrophes\" on Harbor Island . In response the Port Aransas Conservancy released the following statement: \"The agreement struck between the City of Port Aransas and the Port of Corpus Christi does not clear the way for the construction of a crude oil terminal for VLCCs on Harbor Island . The Port of Corpus Christi has not secured the environmental permits or the private financing necessary to proceed , nor has it justified to the citizens of Nueces County the ecological and economic risks the project entails . The settlement simply puts to rest the current litigation regarding the marina lease and Harbor Island permitting requirements , while relieving the City of Port Aransas of the massive taxpayer-funded legal costs associated with that litigation . \"The Port Aransas Conservancy and other conservation-minded groups will continue to fight to protect our community from the impacts this misguided project will inflict upon our natural resources , public safety , health and economy.\" The Port Aransas Conservancy is a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) environmental non-profit whose goal is to foster a balance of conservation and economically sustainable uses for Port Aransas and its surrounding neighborhood and waterways while recognizing that our community and economy is dependent on tourism and fisheries within a healthy barrier island coastal ecosystem .

( NYSE: LDP ) ( the \"Fund\" ) with information regarding the sources of the distribution to be paid on September 30 , 2020 and cumulative distributions paid fiscal year-to-date . In December 2016 , the Fund implemented a managed distribution policy in accordance with exemptive relief issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission . The managed distribution policy seeks to deliver the Fund's long-term total return potential through regular monthly distributions declared at a fixed rate per common share . The policy gives the Fund greater flexibility to realize long-term capital gains throughout the year and to distribute those gains on a regular monthly basis to shareholders . The Board of Directors of the Fund may amend , terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time , which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares . The Fund's monthly distributions may include long-term capital gains , short-term capital gains , net investment income and/or return of capital for federal income tax purposes . Return of capital includes distributions paid by the Fund in excess of its net investment income and net realized capital gains and such excess is distributed from the Fund's assets . A return of capital is not taxable; rather , it reduces a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund . The amount of monthly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors , including changes in portfolio and market conditions . At the time of each monthly distribution , information will be posted to cohenandsteers.com and mailed to shareholders in a concurrent notice . However , this information may change at the end of the year because the final tax characteristics of the Fund's distributions cannot be determined with certainty until after the end of the calendar year . Final tax characteristics of all of the Fund's distributions will be provided on Form 1099-DIV , which is mailed after the close of the calendar year .

      "Processing sentence: LimaCorporate Is The First Italian Company To Obtain The EU Quality Certificate Under The MDR English espa ol Deutsch Italia - Italiano Fran ais Italy - English SAN DANIELE DEL FRIULI , Italy , July 30 , 2020 / / LimaCorporate announces that it is the first Italian company to obtain the EU Quality Management System certificate under the new European Medical Devices Regulation ( MDR ) from T V S D . In 2015 , LimaCorporate formalized the development of a line of customized products - prostheses made for the specific needs and requirements of patients . It is precisely for these custom products that LimaCorporate has received this certification in accordance with the new MDR regulation . With this certification , LimaCorporate is allowed to place custom-made implantable devices in the market in compliance with MDR requirements , one year ahead of the date of application; this will go into effect in May 2021 . The certification process was brilliantly passed thanks to consolidated regulatory experience , competence and commitment in the search for new materials and technologies , such as pioneering the use of 3D printing in the production of prosthetic implants , and constant attention to areas of improvement . LimaCorporate has always been committed to attaining the highest levels of quality . In 2006 , when the company started designing patient-specific medical devices and utilizing a new manufacturing technology , i.e. , 3D printing , there was no roadmap for the creation of quality systems . Over the years , LimaCorporate has evolved , improved , and validated its quality approach to always be ahead of the curve . LimaCorporate officially launched ProMade , a service that provides custom-made solutions , in 2015 . Considering the high variability associated with these complex orthopedic reconstructions , this certification is a confirmation of all the hard work and dedication to quality that began back in 2006 . This achievement is also a result of the company's collaboration with T V S D , specifically T V Italia , the certification body that adds value to its partners and customers through a comprehensive portfolio of testing , certifying , and auditing . \"In the context of bringing profound changes to the medical device industry , the partnership with T V S D is valuable for LimaCorporate . Thanks to the expertise developed by T V S D , especially for the MDR , LimaCorporate has foreseen and evolved its processes so that the devices comply with the relevant requirements of the new regulation , which is a milestone for LimaCorporate and Italian medical device manufacturers . This agility and technical preparation in LimaCorporate has allowed us to anticipate the future of technology and transform orthopedics once again,\" explains Luigi Ferrari , CEO of LimaCorporate . About LimaCorporate LimaCorporate is a global medical device company providing reconstructive and custom-made Orthopedic solutions to surgeons who face the challenges of improving the quality of life of their patients .

In the fall issueof the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons , Paul Driessen , J.D.,examines the evidence and the legal process in this case study of litigation that is destroying companies and technology . Law firms are still soliciting clients for lawsuits in which cumulative awards could reach trillions of dollars , Driessen writes . Introduced in 1974 , glyphosate is the world's most widely used herbicide , he notes . Millions ofhomeowners , gardeners , and farmers use it regularly to killweeds.Countless farmers employ it with \"Roundup-Ready\"corn , soybeans , cotton , and other crops that are geneticallyengineered to be resistant to it . That lets them practice no-tillfarmingwhich means a couple of spray treatments eliminatethe need to use stoop labor to control weeds . Is it carcinogenic? Thousands ofstudies conducted by respected organizationsworldwide have concluded that it is not , including the U.S . Agricultural Health Study , conducted by theNational Cancer Institute and other agencies , which has followedthe health of more than 52,000 licensed private pesticideapplicators for more than two decades . The onlyagency claiming otherwise is the France-basedInternational Agency for Cancer Research ( IARC ) ,Driessen states . In2015 , IARC ruledthat glyphosate is a \"probable\" human carcinogen , based on two studies of miceandhas been accused of manipulating even those studies ( while ignoring other studies ) to get its desired results,Driessen writes . The other 82 entities IARC classifies as \"probably carcinogenic\" include acetaldehyde in bread , emissions from high-temperature food frying , red meat,drinking \"very hot\" beverages , and working as a hairdresser . At one trial , defendants were barred from presenting contrary conclusions from other agencies . Plaintiffs were not cross-examined regarding exposure to any of theother 500 things that IARC considers to be definitely , probably , or possibly carcinogenic , Driessen points out . With this as a prime example , Driessen concludes that \"mass tort 'jackpot justice'law firms continue to deviseand implement better strategies , skills , technologies,alliances , financing , and ability to capitalize on previousvictoriesmaking them one of the biggest threats America'scorporations , technologies , legal system , and society haveever faced.\" The Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons is published by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons ( AAPS ) , a national organization representing physicians in all specialties since 1943 .

      "Processing sentence: Study by Dolphin Technologies reveals a quarter of all car accidents happen in the first three minutes of driving English Franais Deutsch Italia - Italiano espaol English Dolphin Technologies has analyzed the behavior of 40,000 drivers over a period of two years to investigate the causes of traffic accidents . One result is particularly interesting: 25 percent of all accidents happen within the first three minutes of driving . VIENNA , Sept . 17 , 2020 / / The Austrian telematics provider Dolphin Technologies specializes in leveraging technology to prevent road traffic accidents . Drivers who use Dolphin's system receive incentives , such as a discount on their insurance premium , for engaging in low-risk driving behavior like not using a phone while driving , and respecting speed limits . Trip duration and relative risk of accidents ( PRNewsfoto/Dolphin Technologies ) \"A self-induced accident is often the result of wrong decisions or lack of information,\" says Harald Trautsch , CEO of Dolphin . \"One drives tired , drunk , or uses the phone at the wheel . Or one doesn't know that extreme weather conditions such as black ice prevail on the route.\" In a recent study based on anonymized data obtained through Dolphin's system , the telematics provider analyzed 3.2 million car trips by 40,000 people in 2018 and 2019 , in which a total of 1,986 accidents occurred . In particular , the study examined the duration and correlation between the length of car journeys and the probability of an accident . The data revealed that most trips ( 87% ) last less than 30 minutes while only 1% of all trips last longer than one hour . The lowest risk of accident in relative terms was for trips lasting between 10 and 20 minutes . After that , the risk rises disproportionately . If you are in the car for more than 40 minutes , you already have two and a half times the risk than if you are driving for less than 20 minutes.However , a closer look at short trips - here defined as trips lasting less than 10 minutes - revealed some very interesting details . Notably , 25 percent of all accidents occurred during the first 3 minutes of driving , and another 14 percent within the first 6 minutes . \"This study shows that if we could encourage people to give up their cars for short distances , up to 40 percent of all accidents could be avoided,\" says Katharina Sallinger , Chief Data Scientist at Dolphin and head of the study . \"We want to support people in being on the road safely . Knowing which behavior leads to accidents enables us to make targeted recommendations , and thus to minimize risks.\" The expert's tips: Avoid short trips if possible and cycle or walk For longer journeys , plan and keep regular breaks Do not use your cell phone while driving . It causes 26 percent of accidents Photo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1274494/Dolphin_Technologies.jpg?p=original Logo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1274454/Dolphin_Technologies_Logo.jpgContact us: Dolphin Technologies GmbH , Lisa Eisenberger , [emailprotected]\n"

The team used readily available enterprise-grade and open source technology to build an AR app in just four weeks . The approach demonstrates how quickly any business can leverage existing technology to build a working AR experience . The retail industry is having to quickly adapt during the COVID pandemic to reduce in-person interactions . Using augmented reality , the Contentstack prototype helps retailers and brands to create touchless , engaging self-service experiences . Retailers using AR technology in this way can better attract customers to brick-and-mortar stores and increase foot traffic . \"This app showcases how fast and easy it is to innovate with AR it isn't scary or difficult and we have the blueprint,\" said Sonja Kotrotsos , Head of Product Marketing for Contentstack . \"Rolling out immersive content experiences is a differentiator for brands . Rather than simply relying on text and video to tell their stories , brands and retailers can use emerging technologies to build engaging , dynamic content-rich experiences that tell those stories in new , more digestible ways . We are helping businesses develop a digital landscape that is dynamic , easily changeable and extensible to fit with emerging technologies like AR.\" Using microservices , API-first , cloud-native SaaS and headless ( MACH ) technologies , Contentstack and Valtech built a prototype application that simulates using web-based AR within an in-store shopping experience for a skincare product category , specifically serums . In the first scenario , the app demonstrates the point of sale ( POS ) experience , selecting serums from a range of available options , with information on ingredients and product reviews . At this stage , a personalized recommendation can be offered to the customer based on integrations with influencer marketing programs or via a pre-existing profile , such as purchase history or personal skincare goals . The next scenario highlights the \"first use\" experience . Once the customer has purchased the serum , they are able to access the same AR application at home to receive usage instructions . This could include how much to use , at which step in the routine , how frequently and any information on contraindications based on their existing skincare regimen . The last scenario demonstrates how customers can use the same AR application after using the product for a period of time . Personalized recommendations can be given to adjust use , offer repurchase , suggest a different product ( e.g . concentration of active ingredients ) or propose complementary products .

With less than a month to go , nearly 3 in 10 Pennsylvanians are still uncounted . Pennsylvanians are encouraged to respond to the census by mail , phone or online by September 30 . \"We strongly believe that everyone should be counted in the census,\" states Bill Johnston-Walsh , AARP Pennsylvania State Director . \"When you respond to the census , you help your community get its fair share of the hundreds of billions in federal funds spent on schools , hospitals , roads , public works and other vital programs every year.\" Census information helps health providers predict the spread of diseases through communities with children or elderly people . And when disasters hit , the census tells rescuers how many people will need their help . The census is also used to draw the lines of legislative districts and to determine Pennsylvania's representation in Congress . Businesses use census data to decide where to build factories , offices and stores , which creates jobs and generates economic activity while also helping industry reduce financial risk and locate potential markets . Efforts to ensure a complete census count will include door-knocking efforts , although an AARP survey found that 40 percent of those who have not yet participated in the survey are unwilling to talk to a census worker who comes to their door . Other efforts include collecting responses online , over the phone and by mail will continue through the end of September . This new date is \"in response to the Bureau's need to accelerate the completion of data collection and apportionment counts to meet the statutory deadline of December 31.\" AARP has signed onto a letter from The Census Project , which AARP has been part of , asking Congress to statutorily extend the census reporting deadline to allow more time to provide a full and complete count . Specifically , the Census Project and co-signers are urging Congress to extend the December 31 statutory reporting deadline by four months . Pennsylvanians can take the 2020 Census online at 2020census.gov , by mailing in the census forum , or by calling 844-330-2020 ( English ) , 844-468-2020 ( Spanish ) / 844-467-2020 ( TTD ) .

( STI ) ( Nasdaq: SCON ) will effect a one-for-ten ( 1:10 ) reverse split of its common stock on September 10 , 2020 . The reverse stock split , which was authorized by its Board of Directors , was approved by STI's stockholders on September 9 , 2020 . Upon market open Thursday , September 10 , 2020 , STI's common stock will continue trading under the symbol SCON on a split-adjusted basis with a new CUSIP number: 867931 701 . STI has implemented the reverse stock split for the purpose of regaining compliance with the Nasdaq Stock Market's listing maintenance standard that requires STI to maintain at least a $1.00 per share minimum bid price . The reverse stock split will reduce the number of outstanding shares of STI common stock from approximately 31,517,833 shares as of August 7 , 2020 , to approximately 3,151,783 shares outstanding post-split . Correspondingly , the initial trading price of STI common stock is expected to proportionately increase immediately following the reverse stock split . However , other factors may adversely affect the price of our common stock and there can be no assurance that the reverse stock split will increase the trading price of our common stock . Additionally , there is no assurance that the reverse stock split will allow us to regain and maintain compliance with the Nasdaq Stock Market's listing maintenance standard . In the reverse stock split , each ten shares of issued and outstanding common stock will be converted automatically into one share of common stock . No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse stock split , and stockholders who would be entitled to fractional shares will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares . The reverse stock split will also have a proportionate effect on all stock options and warrants outstanding as of September 10 , 2020 . In conjunction with the reverse stock split , the authorized shares of common stock are being reduced by the same one-for-ten ratio , resulting in 25,000,000 shares of authorized capital stock . Stockholders who hold their shares in brokerage accounts or in \"street name\" will not be required to take any action to effect the exchange of their shares . Stockholders of record as of September 10 , 2020 , who hold share certificates will receive instructions from STI's transfer agent , Computershare , explaining the process for obtaining new post-split stock certificates . Computershare will act as the exchange agent for purposes of implementing the exchange of stock certificates . Additional information on the reverse split can be found in STI's definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 10 , 2020 , which is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and on the company's website .

Trusted Revenue Innovation for Smart Healthcare TRISH will analyze the areas of the revenue cycle that are most problematic for healthcare organizations: eligibility , authorizations , pre-certification , claims status , and the like . TRISH will reduce the administrative burden without human intervention , learn & adapt as new variables are introduced and ensure accurate reimbursement without endless iterations of re-work . TRISH is the result of a joint venture between the Healthcare Advisory Group of Windham Brannon , the Atlanta-based accounting and consulting firm , and Deep Indigo , a data science firm with proven success delivering artificial intelligence ( AI ) and machine learning ( ML ) solutions across multiple industry verticals . The joint venture is called SHOAR Health , LLC ( SHOAR , for Smart Health Operations and Revenue Solutions ) . \"The revenue cycle is extremely rigorous,\" Windham Brannon Healthcare Practice Leader Valerie Barckhoff said . \"HIPAA laws back in 1996 gave us an outline for how to communicate the pieces back and forth , but healthcare organizations still struggle to manage the data.Reducing errors and inefficiencies can ultimately reduce the cost of doing business for healthcare organizations , increase revenue , and allow hospitals to focus on taking care of patients,\" Barckhoff said . Barckhoff teamed up with Vipin Ramani , of Deep Indigo , to match her extensive revenue cycle expertise with his AI/ML expertise to develop TRISH . Ramani holds B.S . and Ph.D . degrees in Electrical Engineering and AI from Georgia Tech and holds more than forty ( 40 ) patents . He has created applications for industries spanning financial services , law , accounting , government , manufacturing , transportation , and retail . His AI/ML solutions have been deployed at organizations like Bank of America , the United States Air Force , and Northrop Grumman . In healthcare organizations , key areas that create revenue leaks include: 1 . Poor front-end data2 . Missing or delayed referral3 . Missing prior authorization4 . Ineffective use of billing edits5 . Lagging collection times6 . Inconsistent follow-up7 . Poor denials management Each of these areas represents a function typically rife with administrative confusion , significant human staff intervention , and frequent re-work . Accurate reimbursement is compromised , and , in many cases , patient care is impacted by preventable delays and uncertainty . TRISH promises to correct and automate the associated workflow and free staff to pursue higher value efforts .

The Images Luxury Nail Lounge salons are alleging that the Government violates their constitutional rights under the federal and California Constitutions due to enforcement of Governor Newsom's March 19 , 2020 , executive order . While other similar businesses have subsequently been permitted to open , nail salons remain shuttered . Tony Nguyen , General Manager of the Image Luxury Nail Lounge salons , notes that \"the Vietnamese community has been singled out in this unfair and arbitrary order.\" Vietnamese own 80% of the 11,000 nail salons in California . Mr . Nguyen points out that \"since the State , County and Cities have now allowed hair salons to fully reopen , it is evident that the government is enforcing these laws in a racist manner . With hair , for example , the stylist is right in your face , while with a nail salon , you can be an arm's length away . Yet hair salons have already been allowed to fully reopen , but Vietnamese owned nail salons are effectively not.\" While nail salons are now allowed to open outdoors , Mr . Nguyen states , \"we can't open outside . Most of the malls we are in won't allow it , and our chairs and equipment are bolted into the floor.\" The claims filed today note that there has been no income for six months although nail salons continue to have fix costs such as lease obligations , licensing fees and taxes , etc . Moreover , nail salons have made the necessary accommodations to ensure the safety of their clients , including , but not limited to , mandated masks and social distancing measures , eliminating indoor waiting areas , incorporating touch-free check-in and check-out , only using every other chair , etc . These accommodations make nail salons safe or safer than other businesses . Despite these accommodations , nail salons continue to be closed while other less safe businesses have been allowed to open . Mr .

      "Processing sentence: WHOI-NOAA Partnership Tackles Critical Gap In Climate Knowledge Remote technologies , machine learning will improve simulations of polar ice melt and implications for the global climate WOODS HOLE , Mass. , Oct . 7 , 2020 / / Researchers at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ( WHOI ) were recently awarded a $500,000 grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's ( NOAA ) Climate Observations and Monitoring ( COM ) program to develop machine learning tools to improve estimates of air-sea heat exchange in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas . These tools are expected to fill critical gaps in climate models , which currently show large disparities when simulating the rate of polar ice melt . Recent advances in remote sensing technologies have provided researchers with the data they need to better understand the forces behind Arctic ice melt and the implications of that heat exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere . These real-world measurements will allow researchers to develop machine learning algorithms that will validate and improve satellite-based modeling of the Arctic and subarctic regions . Lisan Yu , a WHOI senior scientist and the project's principal investigator , said a machine learning-based framework will improve the accuracy of ocean-surface forcing estimates used to model the global climate . She said it will also improve the accuracy of ice and weather forecasts in a region that is rapidly opening up to commercial exploration . \"Arctic surface air temperature is rising twice as fast as the rest of the world , and its sea ice is retreating up to three times faster than the rate projected by climate model simulations,\" said Yu . \"The significant underestimate of Arctic sea-ice-loss in models underscores critical gaps in knowledge concerning interactions between the atmosphere , the polar ocean , and ice-covered regions . This project brings all available observations together in a consistent and comprehensive manner to help models make accurate predictions , which are vital for the development of effective policy responses to climate change.\" Due to the difficulty of accessing the Arctic Ocean especially during the stormy winter months and the complexity of measuring air-sea heat exchanges , there has previously not been enough quality data to incorporate ice melt and seasonal changes into climate models . This challenge was overcome by recent advances in long-term remote data collection at high latitudes . For the first time in 2019 , an Ocean Observatories Initiative ( OOI ) surface buoy in the Irminger Sea collected over a year's worth of sensor data , including icy and windy winter conditions . Located in an important area of ocean circulation , the data collected from the OOI surface buoy provides critical verification for satellite-based models . The project also benefits from data collected over a wide area of the Arctic by Saildrone . From May to September 2019 , six of the company's wind- and solar-powered unmanned surface vehicles ( USVs ) surveyed the Chukchi and Bering Seas , gathering data on air and sea conditions right up to the ice edge .

      "Processing sentence: Global Turbine Market to Expand 3.2% Annually Through 2024 Despite COVID Slowdown in 2020 CLEVELAND , Sept . 3 , 2020 / / A new Freedonia Group analysis projects the world market for turbines and related products to rise 3.2% annually to $214 billion in 2024 , boosted by growth in electricity generation and turbine engine production . Though the COVID-19 pandemic is causing steep near-term declines in key markets particularly the large aircraft engine segment demand is expected to rebound to former levels in all segments beyond 2020 as travel and construction patterns renormalize . Highlighted below are some other key trends covered in the report: Wind Turbines to See Fastest Growth Among Electricity-Generation Products Among electricity generation applications , wind turbines will offer the fastest growth prospects and the best opportunities . Many countries are increasing wind energy construction to meet renewable energy targets set by federal governments or as part of a larger signatory body such as the Paris Agreement . Many of these renewable energy targets are set for 2025 and will likely lead to a ramping up of new wind energy installations in 2023 and 2024 . Asia/Pacific Region , Led by China , Will Power Global Turbine Demand Through 2024 China will continue to dominate the global turbine market in 2024 , when the country will account for 28% of global demand . Over half of all gains in the country will stem from demand for wind turbines , as the country will continue to add substantial amounts of wind energy generation capacity to meet its growing energy requirements . China's turbine market will also benefit from the country's push to become a significant global supplier of commercial aircraft , which will boost sales of turbine engines . The same factors driving turbine growth in China hold true for India , though on a much smaller scale as the country is less developed than its regional neighbor . Still , robust investment in wind energy systems ( India has set a goal to almost double its installed wind energy generation capacity between 2019 and 2022 ) will result in the India outperforming nearly all other nations . Looking for More? Global Turbines is now available from The Freedonia Group . This study analyzes global supply of and demand for turbines , turbine-based engines , generators , and generator sets . Specific products covered include gas combustion turbines , steam turbines , hydraulic turbines , wind turbines , microturbines , turbine-based engines ( both aircraft and marine ) , and turbine-based generators and generator sets . Demand is also segmented by global region and market: power generation aircraft ( including space vehicle ) engines other markets , including marine turbine engines and specialty industrial applications found mostly in petroleum and gas-related settings , such as gas pipeline compressor drives About The Freedonia Group The Freedonia Group , a division of MarketResearch.com , is a leading international industrial research company publishing more than 100 studies annually .

      "Processing sentence: States Can Require All New Vehicles Sold Within Borders to Be Electric SEATTLE , Aug . 13 , 2020 / / Recent U.S . Supreme Court precedent has opened the door for states to enact laws requiring all new cars sold in the state to be electric as of a certain date , according to a law journal article by the nonprofit Coltura published today in the University of Michigan Journal of Environmental and Administrative Law . Continue Reading Coltura The article finds that state vehicle electrification mandates can withstand legal challenges based on federal preemption if they are based solely on reasons for transitioning to electric vehicles that are within the state's authority . Such reasons include advantages to the electrical grid such as load balancing and energy storage , increased jobs and economic development , reduced stormwater pollution and consumer savings . States should avoid basing electrification mandates on vehicle emissions reduction and fuel economy grounds exclusively within federal control under the federal Clean Air Act and Energy Policy and Conservation Act . The article points to the 2019 Supreme Court case of Virginia Uranium v Warren , which limited the ability of courts to scrutinize state motives in enacting statutes . \"The Supreme Court has signaled openness to allowing states to go their own way on environmental matters,\" said Matthew Metz , lead author of the article and founder of Coltura , a nonprofit seeking to move the country beyond gasoline . \"This is how our federal system should work , with states as laboratories of democracy.\" Seventeen countries have already announced plans to phase out sales of new internal combustion engine vehicles , with start dates ranging from 2025 to 2040 . Four states , California , Hawaii , Massachusetts and Washington , collectively representing about 15% of the U.S . auto market , have all considered bills effectively requiring all new cars sold in the state to be electric . Passage of these bills could create a seismic shift in the U.S . auto market . The Washington bill , drafted according to the legal path identified in the law review article , required all new cars to be electric by 2030 . The bill , HB 2515 , introduced in the 2020 legislative session , gained the support of eight committee chairs in its first year . Advocates intend to seek passage of a similar bill in 2021.A paper accepted for presentation at the World EV Symposium that summarizes the law review article is here.CONTACT: Matthew Metz 206-799-2795 [email protected] https://www.coltura.org/SOURCE Coltura\n"

The forum was initiated by the Center for Strategic Research in Civil Aviation ( CSR CA ) , one of the largest organizers of professional aviation events . The forum , held on the EURASIAN.NETWORK online platform , brought together leading Russian and foreign industry experts: representatives of state regulatory bodies and senior managers of airlines , airports , handling agents and other companies involved in air cargo transportation . The participants discussed a wide range of issues related to the impact of the pandemic on the aviation business , including forecasts for the restoration of air traffic on international passenger routes , the dynamics of cargo turnover and the prospects for the development of supply chains in the context of COVID-19 . One of the key topics was the industry's readiness to handle temperature-sensitive cargo , primarily pharmaceuticals . According to the international agency WorldACD , medical and pharmaceutical goods were the only category of cargo for which there was an increase in air transportation volumes in the first half of 2020 compared to 2019.This trend was due to a sharp increase in demand and the need for prompt deliveries of medical goods , mainly personal protection equipment and ventilators to the regions impacted by the coronavirus . The logistics industry is now preparing to transport and store the COVID-19 vaccine . Taking into account that the expected temperature stability of the vaccine will be +2 + 8 C , the primary burden will be on the air transport industry , whose share of the global volume of cargo transportation in the cold chain system , according to experts , exceeded 70% even before the pandemic . In this regard , the participants were particularly interested in the remarks of Elena Konkina , Commercial Director of Moscow Cargo LLC , invited by the conference organizers as the keynote speaker for the panel discussion \"Air cargo industry in a new reality . Development of cargo terminals\" . In her remarks , Ms . Konkina discussed the requirements of the market for modern terminal infrastructure and the quality of TTSP ( time & temperature sensitive products ) cargo handling , and how the largest cargo terminal in Russia manages to ensure compliance with all the conditions of the \"cold chain\" and withstand strict temporary standards for ground handling of pharmaceutical cargo . Moscow Cargo LLC is a modern high-tech cargo aviation terminal and the main handling operator of Sheremetyevo International Airport , which serves 72.5% of the airport's cargo and postal turnover . Today , the Moscow Cargo terminal has a total area of 42,300 m , designed to handle 380 thousand tons of cargo per year .

Through the fund , HealthWell will provide up to $6,600 in financial assistance for a 12-month grant period to eligible patients who have annual household incomes up to 500 percent of the federal poverty level . About Adrenal InsufficiencyAccording to the National Adrenal Diseases Foundation ( NADF ) , adrenal insufficiency is a life-threatening disorder caused by impaired secretion of vital hormones produced in the cortex of adrenal glands , small glands located just above the kidneys . This condition can be caused by primary destruction or dysfunction of the adrenal glands ( Primary Adrenal Insufficiency , PAI ) or impairment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ( Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency , SAI ) . There are several causes of PAI: autoimmunity ( often referred to as Addison's disease ) , adrenal infiltration or injury , congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( CAH ) , adrenal hypoplasia congenital , adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) insensitivity syndromes , drug induced , or other metabolic disorders . Secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs in people with certain conditions that affect the pituitary gland . Most people with SAI have it from use of suppressive doses of glucocorticoids for other illnesses . Adrenal insufficiency affects the body's ability to respond to stress and maintain other essential life functions . Patients require daily replacement doses of glucocorticoids and in most cases also mineralocorticoid hormones . With treatment , most people with adrenal insufficiency can have a fairly normal , active life . The most serious complication of adrenal insufficiency is called adrenal crisis . If not treated immediately , adrenal crisis can lead to death . \"We are honored to work with the HealthWell Foundation to provide financial assistance for those who need it most and to raise awareness about adrenal insufficiency . The fund for adrenal insufficiency patients will support the financial needs of the community,\" said Kalina Warren , NADF Board President . \"Especially during a pandemic , there are many who are having great difficulty keeping up with medical expenses . Adrenal insufficiency is a chronic condition and the medications are life-preserving , so there is no option but to continue taking them . Working together , we can help patients continue lifesaving treatments that would otherwise not be attainable.\" \"People living with adrenal insufficiency can experience difficulties in daily life due to fatigue , stress , and lack of energy . Proper diagnosis and treatment are essential for patients to be able to manage their condition,\" said Krista Zodet , HealthWell Foundation President . \"If untreated , AI can cause serious , irreversible damage and , possibly death . Thanks to the generosity of our donors , we are now able to offer people living\n"

      "Processing sentence: Despite Pandemic , Back-to-School Ritual Means Success for Cleveland Consumer Products Co . CLEVELAND , Aug . 18 , 2020 / / Pulsar Products is going strong , even as the COVID-19 pandemic continues . Being nimble and adaptive is critical to the company's surviving and thriving . And while the company pivoted early during the pandemic to deliver over 10 million PPE masks to customers including the Mayo Clinic and the U.S . Navy , this time of year , the focus is on its line of school and office supplies , which are sold at major retailers , including Meijer , Dollar Tree , Dollar General and soon available at Walmart . Are school supplies still a 'thing' in this time of remote classroom learning that relies on laptops? \"Yes,\" says Buffalo , New York clinical psychologist Amy Shuman , Ph.D. , \"Continuing the time-honored tradition of back-to-school shopping is not only fun , but also mentally healthy for kids of all ages whether you're shopping online or in-person . Rituals keep us grounded and help normalize what otherwise is a very difficult time right now for children.\" Additionally , whether students are heading back to classrooms , or will attend virtually from home , they still need fresh and unmarked planners , notebooks , journals and binders to keep homework and class projects well-organized . Pulsar's products , with of-the-moment designs and vivid hues , attract attention in stores . But adaptation was required here , too . Because Pulsar relied on manufacturing in China , it was clear that might be a challenge for its supply chain . So , company leaders shifted to using printers in Detroit , Michigan and manufacturers in Bedford Heights , Ohio . Something that hasn't changed: the company's creative team at its Cleveland headquarters , which is constantly generating fresh and lively content , is intact . None of Pulsar's 19 employees have lost their jobs since the pandemic began . \"Pulsar continues to be successful because we are nimble and use our human capital effectively . Our entrepreneurial/startup mindset combined with our flexible and open workplace culture drives us to think differently than our competitors and provides an atmosphere that promotes creative freedom,\" says Eric Ludwig , who co-founded the firm in 1997 with his brother Mike . About Pulsar Products: Pulsar is a thriving , entrepreneurial consumer product company servicing national retailers , cruise lines , and special events companies . Started in 1997 in a basement , this family business' products are now found in over 25,000 locations worldwide . www.PulsarProducts.com .

      "Processing sentence: Washington Monthly Releases 2020 Best Colleges Guide Guide features best institutions for majors popular with Black students WASHINGTON , Aug . 31 , 2020 / / The Washington Monthlymagazine today released its 2020 College Guide and Rankings , the socially conscious alternative to U.S . News & World Report . While U.S . News rewards colleges and universities for their wealth , exclusivity , and prestige , the Monthly ranks them on how well they serve the country as a wholeby recruiting and graduating non-wealthy students , encouraging student activism , and producing research and technologies that create high-paying jobs and address threats like climate change . These new rankings are especially important now , with mass unemployment , the inequalities exposed by COVID-19 , and the nationwide protests against racial injustice . This year , the Monthly is also listing the schools that make sure majors popular with Black students lead to well-paying jobs , the first time any publication has done so . The Washington Monthly's unique methodology yields multiple fascinating results: While 19 of U.S . News and World Report's top 20 national universities are elite private institutions , more than half of the Washington Monthly's top 20 are public institutions . For instance , Texas A&M , ranked 70th by U.S . News , is 12th on the Washington Monthly list because it enrolls and graduates enormous numbers of first-generation and Pell grant students as well as science and engineering PhDs . Last year , the school graduated more Pell Grant recipients than Stanford , Harvard , Yale , and Princeton combined . Other elite private national universities that score in U.S . News's top 20 do less well on oursincluding Northwestern ( 30th on our list ) , Brown ( 37th ) , and Johns Hopkins ( 54th ) . Meanwhile , Utah State University , 254th on U.S . News's list , is 10th on the Monthly's because it charges lower-income students so little in tuition and graduates so many . In the liberal arts category , Berea College , 3rd on our list for its extraordinary record of recruiting and graduating lower-income students , is 46th on U.S . News's . St . Mary's College of Maryland , 29th on our list for the same reason , is 92nd on theirs . The colleges that score well on the Monthly's rankings are swimming against the tide of a higher education system that forces non-affluent students to pay ever-higher tuition , take on ever-growing amounts of debt , and mortgage their futures . This same system has put many admirable small schools , including Beloit College ( 30th on our liberal arts college list ) and Hiram College ( the 3rd best bachelor's college ) under severe financial stress made worse by the pandemic . That's why , as part of this year's college guide , Monthly guest editor and education expert Kevin Careyhas detailed a plan that could save these schools by binding them together in a federally supported , affordable financial network . \"Today's\n",

The webcast will be available through the \"Investors\" section of the Mirati website at https://ir.mirati.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx , and a replay of the webcast will be made available for 90 days following the event . About Mirati Therapeutics Mirati Therapeutics ( NASDAQ: MRTX ) is a San Diego-based clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to advancing novel therapeutics that extend the lives of patients by directly addressing the genetic and immunological drivers of cancer . Mirati is developing sitravatinib , designed to selectively target a spectrum of tyrosine kinases implicated in both tumor growth and the suppression of immune responses to tumors . Sitravatinib has demonstrated durable responses in lung cancer patients whose cancer has progressed despite treatment with checkpoint inhibitors - an area of significant unmet medical need . Sitravatinib is being evaluated in multiple clinical trials to treat patients who are refractory to prior immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy , including a potentially registration-enabling Phase 3 trial of sitravatinib in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) that is currently enrolling patients . Mirati is also developing novel inhibitors of KRAS mutations including MRTX849 , a potent and selective inhibitor of KRAS G12C . This historically difficult to drug target is present in approximately 14% of NSCLC adenocarcinomas , 4% of colorectal cancer as well as smaller percentages of several other difficult-to-treat cancers . MRTX849 is being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial as a treatment for patients with KRAS G12C-positive tumors . Our research in KRAS G12C has led to breakthroughs in targeting other KRAS mutations , including G12D , which drives tumor growth in more patients than G12C and includes pancreatic , colorectal and other types of cancer . Our lead clinical candidate for KRAS G12D , MRTX1133 , is in IND-enabling studies . For more information , visit www.mirati.com . SOURCE Mirati Therapeutics , Inc .

The selected poster has been awarded the 2020 Annual NEALS Meeting UMN/PLS Poster Award . The poster , entitled \"The mitochondrial targeted peptidomimetic SBT-272 protects cortical spinal motor neurons from mutant TDP43 pathology,\" demonstrates that SBT-272 protects upper motor neurons from mutant TDP43 driven neurodegeneration . TDP43 pathology has been observed in multiple neurodegenerative diseases , including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( ALS ) , Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration ( FTLD ) , Lewy Body Dementia ( LBD ) , Progressive Supranuclear Palsy ( PSP ) , and Alzheimer's Disease , and is believed to play a role in neuronal cell death . The data from this study supports further investigation of SBT-272 for the treatment of these and other neurodegenerative diseases in which TDP43 pathology is thought to contribute to disease burden . About SBT-272 SBT-272 is a novel peptidomimetic being developed for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases involving mitochondrial dysfunction . SBT-272 has been shown to increase adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) production and decrease levels of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in dysfunctional mitochondria in preclinical studies . SBT-272 demonstrates higher mitochondrial uptake and greater concentrations in the central nervous system relative to elamipretide , Stealth's first-in-class lead compound . Treatment with SBT-272 was associated with a dose-dependent delay in the onset of neurological disease , a reduction in systemic markers of neurodegeneration and prolonged lifespan in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) . In addition , SBT-272 treatment was associated with the preservation of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of a mouse model of mutant alpha-synuclein driven neurodegeneration . Alpha-synucleinopathy is a common pathological feature of several neurodegenerative diseases , including Parkinson's Disease , Multiple Systems Atrophy and Alzheimer's Disease . Further preclinical evaluation ofSBT-272 in the context of protein misfolding diseases which lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent neurodegeneration is on-going . About Stealth We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery , development and commercialization of novel therapies for diseases involving mitochondrial dysfunction . Mitochondria , found in nearly every cell in the body , are the body's main source of energy production and are critical for normal organ function . Dysfunctional mitochondria characterize a number of rare genetic diseases and are involved in many common age-related diseases , typically involving organ systems with high energy demands such as the heart , the eye , and the brain .

Moreover , several companies are actively striving to create and launch solutions that not only allow patients to diagnose and confirm disease symptoms , and consult with doctors / physicians remotely , but also offer therapeutic aid . Although the focus of such companies is presently on diabetes , mental health disorders and musculoskeletal injuries , experts believe that digital therapeutics may eventually replace / augment traditional treatment measures , with clinically validated software . , It is worth noting that there are several successful start-ups focused on designing and development of digital therapeutics; in fact , most such companies are backed by noteworthy investors . A number of digital health solutions are already in the market , and several other innovative solutions are under development .

      "Processing sentence: CITGO Lake Charles Update HOUSTON , Sept . 11 , 2020 / / On August 26 , Hurricane Laura came onshore in Cameron , Louisiana as a Category 4 hurricane , making a direct hit on the Lake Charles area . Prior to the storm's arrival and following our severe weather procedures , we safely secured and shut down the refinery without incident.As a good community partner , we also made arrangements to provide fuel to emergency responders and hospitals as soon as the storm passed . In fact , the West Calcasieu Cameron Hospital was the only operational hospital immediately after the storm , running on fuel provided by CITGO . Laura's fierce winds resulted in widespread and extensive damage across Southwest Louisiana . Thankfully , all of our employees are safe but , unfortunately , the majority sustained damage to their homes . The Lake Charles refinery finished the preliminary assessment of the damage from Laura and has put plans in place to make necessary repairs and restart the refinery . Overall , the refinery fared well but sustained significant damage to most of the cooling towers , minor damage to non-critical tanks and a significant amount of miscellaneous non-critical repairs . Repairing the refinery's cooling towers and getting reliable electrical power from the utility grid are critical to restarting the facility . As a result , we expect a phased restart of operations , with all units back in service by mid to late October . We know that restarting fuel supplies is important for the local community , and powering CITGO terminals with generators is a key part of the CITGO business continuity plan.CITGO successfully restarted supply of gasoline at the Lake Charles refinery rack on September 5th following clearing activities by the utility companies.While ULSD was initially retained solely for emergency services and first responders , CITGO restarted its broader supply of ultra-low sulfur diesel ( ULSD ) at the Lake Charles refinery rack on September 8th . We are working hard to restore operations as soon as possible in a way that is safe for our people , the community and the environment . CITGO will continue to provide regular progress updates as we work to get the Lake Charles refinery restored and help the broader Lake Charles community get back on its feet . About CITGOHeadquartered inHouston,Texas , CITGO Petroleum Corporation is a recognized leader in the refining industry with a well-known brand . CITGO operates three refineries located inCorpus Christi , Texas;Lake Charles , La.; andLemont , Ill. , and wholly and/or jointly owns 42 terminals , six pipelines and three lubricants blending and packaging plants . With approximately 3,400 employees and a combined crude capacity of approximately 769,000 barrels-per-day ( bpd ) , CITGO is ranked as the sixth-largest , and one of the most complex independent refiners intheUnited States .

The global diesel generator market size is expected to reach USD 30.0 billion by 2027 , expanding at a CAGR of 8.0% from 2020 to 2027 . Diesel Generators Market Report Highlights Diesel generators are gaining huge traction owing to the longer lifespan of the engine , reliable performance , and low capital cost of the generator The medium power rating segment occupied a significant revenue share in 2019 owing to its application across several industries , including small scale industries , telecom sector , petrol stations , and commercial complexes The commercial application segment accounted for the largest revenue share in 2019 owing to a wide application of the product in data centers , educational institutions , government centers , and other such facilities The market in Asia Pacific is expected to expand at the fastest CAGR over the forecast period owing to rising power demand from developing economies , such as China and India . Proliferating demand for emergency power backup and stand-alone power generation systems across several end-use industries , including manufacturing and construction , telecom , chemical , marine , oil and gas , and healthcare , is likely to strengthen market growth over the forecast period.Rapid industrialization , infrastructure development , and continuous population growth are among the major factors driving the global power consumption . Rising penetration of electronic device load across various commercial scale structures , such as data centers , has resulted in the higher deployment of diesel generators in order to prevent disruption of daily business activities and provide uninterrupted electricity supply during sudden power outages.Diesel generator set manufacturers adhere to several regulations and compliances regarding the safety , design , and installation of the system . For instance , the genset should be designed in facilities certified to ISO 9001 and be manufactured in facilities certified to ISO 9001 or ISO 9002 , with the prototype test program authenticating the performance reliability of the genset design . Certifications to leading organizations such as US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , CSA group , Underwriters Laboratories , and International Building Code are expected to enhance product marketability over the forecast period.Industry participants are continuously focusing on finding the next generation of diesel generators due to strict regulations . These generators have automatic voltage regulators and built-in electronic governors that automatically control the generator engine speed as needed , thereby making the diesel gensets more energy-efficient . Additional features such as remote monitoring of the generator set are expected to boost the product sustainability over the forecast period .
