( ) BWX Technologies , Inc . ( NYSE: BWXT ) ( \"BWXT\" , \"we\" , \"us\" or the \"Company\" ) reported second quarter 2020 revenue of $505 million , a 7% increase compared with $471 million in the second quarter of 2019 . GAAP net income for the second quarter 2020 was $64.3 million , or $0.67 per diluted share , compared with GAAP net income of $58.9 million , or $0.62 per diluted share , in the prior-year period . Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter 2020 was $67.7 million , or $0.71 per diluted share , compared with non-GAAP net income of $59.1 million , or $0.62 per diluted share , in the prior-year period . A reconciliation of non-GAAP results is detailed in Exhibit 1 . BWXT delivered strong second quarter results driven by exceptional operational performance through the first half of the year combined with cost control measures , both of which lead us to increase our 2020 EPS guidance , said Rex D . Geveden , president and chief executive officer . The core Navy franchise continued to beat our internal expectations through a combination of work volume increases and contract performance improvements driven by operational excellence . We remain cautiously optimistic as we continue to navigate a COVID-19 work environment and focus on employee health and safety while maintaining business viability , said Geveden . All 12 of our major production facilities have remained operational , and despite some COVID-19-related impacts , the Nuclear Power Group is well positioned for recovery through the remainder of the year . Second Quarter Segment Results Nuclear Operations Group ( NOG ) segment revenue was $410 million for the second quarter of 2020 , a 14% increase from the prior-year period , driven by accelerated timing of long-lead material procurements and higher downblending and naval nuclear fuel volume . NOG operating income was $86.0 million in the second quarter of 2020 , a 14% increase compared with the prior-year period , driven by higher production volume and the timing of procurement of long-lead material . Second quarter 2020 segment operating margin was 21.0% . Nuclear Power Group ( NPG ) segment revenue was $68.0 million for the second quarter of 2020 , a 22% decrease from the prior-year period primarily due to lower component manufacturing volume , rescheduled commercial nuclear service outages and lower medical isotope production volume due in part to COVID-19 , partially offset by the Laker Energy acquisition . NPG GAAP and non-GAAP operating income was $1.1 million and $2.4 million , respectively , in the second quarter of\n",

A reconciliation of non-GAAP results is detailed in Exhibit 1 .

NOG operating income was $86.0 million in the second quarter of 2020 , a 14% increase compared with the prior-year period , driven by higher production volume and the timing of procurement of long-lead material . Second quarter 2020 segment operating margin was 21.0% . Nuclear Power Group ( NPG ) segment revenue was $68.0 million for the second quarter of 2020 , a 22% decrease from the prior-year period primarily due to lower component manufacturing volume , rescheduled commercial nuclear service outages and lower medical isotope production volume due in part to COVID-19 , partially offset by the Laker Energy acquisition .

The Company now expects net sales to be in the range of $335 million to $345 million ( $350 million to $360 million before taking into account its product replacement reserve ) . This revised guidance compares favorably to the November 6 , 2007 net sales guidance of $315 million to $335 million .
